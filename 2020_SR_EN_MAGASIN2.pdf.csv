           FACILITATE CAREER PATHS
           The Group's environment is constantly changing as a result of changes in consumer trends, changes in the
           competitive environment, new regulations, technological developments, etc., and requires U Enseigne to
           anticipate and adapt its human resources. These changes are both a factor of attention and a source of
           opportunity for our employees.
           We are convinced that the quality of our business depends on the quality of the human relationships we
           are able to create. Attracting talent, developing and adapting skills, encouraging internal mobility, building
           loyalty and ensuring the sustainability of know-how are all levers to respond to the risk of losing
           vitality of the company's social body, to sustainably deal with the changes necessary to maintain the company's
           competitiveness and to enable each employee to build his or her career path.
           Our commitments can be broken down into the following objectives3:
           - Attracting talent
           - Adapt and develop skills
           - Retaining talent

      integrated into and attached to the economic fabric of each region. Concerned with contributing to the
      economic dynamic as close as possible to the stores, U Enseigne favors local cooperation in a network that
      benefits everyone - stores, employees, suppliers, partners and customers.
      In its field of action, in order to respond to the risk of losing momentum in the territories, U Enseigne
      focuses on three objectives:

      exercise of our professional judgment enables us to
      provide a moderate level of assurance conclusion;
      A higher level of assurance would have required more
      extensive audit work.
