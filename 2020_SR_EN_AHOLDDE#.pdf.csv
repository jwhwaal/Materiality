Introduction
Climate change is impacting how food is grown and will change our business
in the future. Ahold Delhaize is committed to supporting the well-being of the
communities we serve and enabling a healthy, low-carbon food system that
secures healthy and sustainable diets for future generations.
In line with the latest climate science to limit global warming, we are
committed to reducing carbon emissions across our value chain
The following contain details on Ahold Delhaize’s emissions reduction targets
and approach, our process for identifying climate related risks, and the
governance and reporting we have put in place to provide transparency to our
commitments and progress.

Reducing carbon emissions, a science-based
approach
In recognition of the urgency of climate change and in support of Sustainable Development Goal
13, Ahold Delhaize has adopted science-based climate targets in 2020.
•    We will reduce absolute emissions from our own operations (scope 1 and 2) by 50% between 		
     2018-2030.
•    We will reduce absolute emissions from our value chain (scope 3) by 15% between
     2018-2030.
                                                                                                 To achieve our ambition, we will focus on three areas:
Reducing impact from our operations – Scopes 1 & 2
                                                                                                 Energy
Continuing the reductions in emissions since 2008 from stores, warehouses, and offices, Ahold
Delhaize and its brands will further reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by     The Ahold Delhaize brands continue to invest in energy

Preparing for climate risk disclosure
Climate change is making it more difficult to farm, fish and raise livestock; it’s changing what
and how we can feed ourselves – at a time when our global population is growing. Climate
change will have an impact on Ahold Delhaize with the potential to disrupt our business model.
Our brands are already experiencing impacts from increasing prevalence of extreme weather
events. For example, hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Florence in 2018 and Dorian in 2019 impacted
Food Lion and Stop & Shop stores, and our brands’ operations in Greece and Serbia were
impacted by flooding in recent years as well.
To better understand and articulate the risks that climate change poses to the company,          In 2020, Ahold Delhaize conducted its first global analysis of

Board and is implemented locally through our brands.
Regional and brand leadership teams are responsible for implementing
climate related actions in the brands. They do this based upon approved
targets and climate related investments from the Executive Committee.
All Supervisory Board members actively participate in the Sustainability
& Innovation Committee which reviews the company’s Health and
Sustainability strategy and progress on a semi-annual basis.

integrated into the Annual Report since 2019. In addition, we report
performance annually to CDP. Going forward, the company will align its
climate reporting with the TCFD recommendations.
