In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted our fragilities and was also an opportunity for intro-
spection and for reassigning priorities to our value system, as human beings and as a Company.
Scientific evidence shows the direct link between the pandemic and sustainability but, as the
UN rightly admonish, the damage from climate change is more persistent, stronger and more
irreversible than any pandemic in the long term.
As stated by the famous British naturalist Sir David Attenborough: “Many individuals are doing
what they can. But real success can only come if there is a change in our societies, in our eco-
nomics and in our politics”. Therefore, we all have a duty to do our part and to be the driving
forces of this evolution, which will undoubtedly be strongly boosted by the National Recovery
and Resilience Plan (NRRP).
In this Sustainability Report we give an account of what we have undertaken in many different
directions: for the community and the region, for our customers and our people, for our suppliers
with whom we have established wholesome collaborations, and for the environment.
I hope that all the passion for our work and for what really matters also shines through. Today’s
Esselunga is the result of the skilled work of many people, to whom I am deeply grateful, who
have given their utmost best in a dramatically difficult year.

                            Esselunga has com-
                            plemented the food
offering by opening Bar Atlantic in many of
its stores.
The 97 Bar Atlantic are by now a well-established
reality in the catering sector and among the
leading ones in its category in Italy, with about
9 million customers each year. The Bar Atlantic
offer a comprehensive catering service: break-
fast, lunch and aperitif, with recipes based on
selected ingredients directly sourced from the
Esselunga supermarkets.
Owing to the COVID-19 emergency, the opera-
tions of the Bar Atlantic significantly decreased
in 2020 and the expansion plan had to be
reviewed.
                   Born in 2002 as Olimpia Beauté,
                   the EsserBella chain now has
                   40 perfumeries in Lombardy,
                   Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and
                   Tuscany.
Face and body care products, the most prestig-
ious make-up brands and trendy fragrances are
offered by these exclusive perfumeries, which,
with over 11,500 items, are able to satisfy even
the most sophisticated clientele.
EsserBella has also renewed its format, turning
into an actual beauty centre.
In addition to high-quality services, the newly-de-
signed perfumeries offer 5 beauty studios: skin,
hair, nails, brows and make-up.

    COLLABORATION WITH Q3CUBE
    Esselunga entrusted the company Q3CUBE with building an algorithmic simulation engine that can provide
    detailed forecasts on the trends of COVID-19 infection and disease in the Company.
    The mathematical model used by the system is updated daily and makes it possible to plot the probable
    evolution in the next 15 days.
MEASURES FOR ACCESS TO THE COMPANY. Stay at home if you have a fever (over 37.5°C) or other flu-like symptoms and call your family doctor and
the Health Authority. Do not enter or do not stay at the company in case of hazardous situations (flu-like symptoms, fever, coming back from at-risk
areas or contact with people diagnosed as positive to the virus in the past 14 days); promptly inform your Managers, complying with the interpersonal
safety distance from those present. Comply with the provisions of the Authorities and of the Employer with regard to accessing or staying in the
company, and, in particular, keep the interpersonal distance and adopt correct hygiene behaviours.

   THE ESSELUNGA LABORATORIES
   Esselunga has built and developed three testing laboratories, located at the sites of Limito di Pioltello,
   Biandrate and Parma, in order to control the safety and quality of in-house production.
   The laboratories also perform sample tests on all other branded items produced at the suppliers’ facilities.
   The sampling and inspections are carried out both by company personnel as well as by specialised
   external companies.
In 2018 Esselunga successfully obtained – at all
production sites – the certification for the food
safety of products FSSC 22000 (Food Safety
System Certification), which was also main-
tained in 2020. In addition, during the year
the organic certification was extended
to the e-commerce platforms, except for new-
ly-built ones. With the aim of identifying the per-
centage of GFSI-certified suppliers of pre-pack-
aged branded products, Esselunga sent to them
an online questionnaire relating to the status
of the certifications in their possession.
The activity carried out, which involved over
1,000 suppliers, made it possible to estimate that
74% of them is GFSI-certified, a percentage that
Esselunga has undertaken to increase by 2025.

   FARM TO FORK
   Farm to Fork is the 10-year project developed by the European Commission for the definition of guidelines on
   biodiversity and diet, aiming to create a more equitable, fairer and more sustainable food system. The project
   envisages the involvement of all agri-food sectors, from production to consumption, including distribution.
   Esselunga plays an active role with a team of experts which constantly takes part in the working tables
   organised at European level on aspects related to hygiene, labelling, voluntary information and traceability,
   as well as on other strategic topics, such as animal welfare, the use of pesticides, the creation of healthy
   nutritional profiles, the revision of the rules on expiry dates and nutrition labelling.

   HANDLING COMPLAINTS MANAGEMENT
   The Company collects and analyses all complaints received by filling in the forms at the stores as well as by
   means of any communication channel (freephone number, e-mail, social media, etc.). The complaints are filed
   by the Customer Service and sent to the competent Departments for the necessary investigation. The Quality
   Assurance Department has the task of carrying out the specific technical analyses and, for branded products,
   its technicians directly provide the customer with feedback on the checks carried out.

4.4 FOOD EDUCATION
Esselunga develops commercial proposals and               choices. Among the most important initiatives,
specific communication plans aimed at raising             there is the creation of the Naturama, BIO, Equi-
consumer awareness on the importance of food              librio and CheJoy branded product lines.
                  Set up in 1996, the Naturama line, which now includes over 250 items, consists of fresh
                  food products with a controlled supply chain and emphasises food safety, animal welfare
                  and respect for the environment to offer only what is naturally good.
                  The philosophy and promotion of organic products at Esselunga have existed since 1999,
                  with an ad hoc brand. Today, there are over 400 Esselunga BIO products including fruit
                  and vegetables, dairy products and packaged products. Healthy food that also respects
                  environmental biodiversity and natural production processes, without using chemicals.
                  Launched in 2013, the Equilibrio line is a line of products that meets the health needs
                  of consumers and features nutritional claims (rich in/source of fibre, lower salt content,
                  lactose free, etc.). In 2017, the line was complemented with gluten-free Equilibrio products,
                  for coeliacs, certified and refundable.
                  In 2019, the CheJoy line was launched, to meet the need for food products specifically
                  designed for children from 4 years of age. The line reassures even the most demanding
                  parents, as the ingredients are of high quality (organic origin is preferred where possible)
                  and no artificial flavourings or colourings are used.
                                                                                                            59

   FOOD EDUCATION - SOME PROJECTS
   SUPER FOODIES - LET’S LEARN TO EAT WELL
   The project is aimed at teaching healthy and proper nutrition to children through play: this is how the Super
   Foodies were born – 24 collectible superheroes, made entirely of recycled plastic, which guide the little ones
   in discovering the nutritional properties of the various natural and nutritional components of each product,
   but also to understanding the proper methods for food preservation, the daily requirements for the body and
   many other interesting facts.
   In 2019, thanks to the collaboration with the IRCCS Foundation, the National Cancer Institute (INT), and
   Madegus (Masters of Taste, spin-off of the Parma University), the “Fruit and vegetables: health allies” catalogue
   was developed, with cards broken down by colour and product, more than one million copies of which were
   distributed. In 2020 the project continued with the second edition of the catalogue, translated into English
   and Spanish, which focused on four sources of protein (white meats, fish products, legumes and eggs),
   for a healthy lifestyle according to the Mediterranean diet model.

   FOOD&SCIENCE FESTIVAL MANTUA
   Esselunga took part in the 2020 edition of the Food&Science
   Festival, a scientific education event of national and international
   significance organised in Mantua that explores issues related to
   the science of food production and consumption. This year the
   Company set up a stand inspired by the Super Foodies, devoted
   to healthy and proper nutrition, and presented the experiences of
   colleagues Giulio Ferrari (Production Director) and Luca Magnani
   (Quality Assurance Director).

   OUR HONEY IS TRACEABLE ON THE FLY
   Esselunga honey now comes from a certified and traceable supply chain: from each jar, you can trace back
   each individual beehive that the product comes from. The project, carried out in collaboration with Apicoltura
   Casentinese, involves all the items of private label honey and allows customers to obtain all the information on
   the purchased product (origin, honey extraction date, production date) by scanning the QR code on the cap.
   The consumer can also find on the Esselunga website cooking ideas on recommended pairings, interesting
   facts and information on the world of bees and on the importance of preserving their role of natural
   pollinators. With this initiative, Esselunga sought to engage on the front lines with the aim of protecting the
   bees’ ecosystem and biodiversity.

2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
   ELIMINATION OF MICRO-PLASTICS IN PRIVATE LABEL DETERGENTS
   In 2020, Esselunga took part in the study by Green-
   peace on the issue of micro-plastics in detergents
   called “Liquid plastic”. Although the analysis had al-
   ready classified Esselunga and Per chi ama la nat-
   ura branded products among the most virtuous,
   the Company decided to further improve its perfor-
   mance and changed their formulas.
   During 2021, the micro-plastics will be fully eliminat-
   ed from all private label items, with the exception
   of one product only, whose formulation currently
   hinders changes.

   PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
   Esselunga has started a very innovative project to implement a Product Lifecycle Management system
   which, also thanks to the cooperation of suppliers, makes it possible to centralise the development process
   management of new private label products and the restyling of existing lines, with a view to reducing time to
   market and improving the information on the packaging.
   Through a carefully arranged workflow that includes all steps of the process, the platform ensures:
   • the standardisation of process activities and the formalisation of the roles concerned;
   • the collaboration and coordination between Esselunga and suppliers, who access the platform to enter
     technical product and packaging information;
   • the collaborative construction of the packaging, automating the preparation of the label texts;
   • the digitalisation of approval processes;
   • the tracing of the nutritional content and intake of products.
   Thanks to the development of this system, in the future it will be possible to further increase transparency
   of branded products and communicate to customers the nutritional, quality and sustainability features in even
   greater detail.

      Like the rest of the country, in March 2020 we
      also ground to a halt, the classrooms emptied
      and the homeworking experience began. Our
      goal was immediately to ensure, to the extent
      possible, the continuity of training activities for
      the whole Company, offering all our courses in
      remote mode.
      In this situation, so different, dramatic and at

      found out I was expecting a baby girl! Obvious-
      ly, my anxiety grew exponentially.
      My first thought was her safety. I alternated of-
      fice time with remote working for as long as the
      situation allowed it, then from October I start-
      ed working from home full time. The Compa-
      ny guaranteed my work was wholly safe, never
      doubting that my managerial role could be less
      effective remotely.
      For me, being a manager means allowing en-
      thusiastic and high-performing teams to grow.

    SKILLS UPDATING PROGRAMMES
    For the employees of the centralised departments training activities
    focused on three main areas: communication, managing and enhancing the
    motivation of employees. The programme saw the involvement of the Group’s
    Managers in specific modules dedicated to the topic of Accountability
    which, through the analysis of real-life cases, allowed them to exercise their
    management and planning abilities in complex situations. Furthermore, for
    all office personnel, ad hoc activities were carried out to aid the switch to
    remote working.
    The adaptation to the new ways of working remotely was also aided thanks to a series of exercises aimed at
    strengthening soft skills, particularly important in this changed situation, personal as well as professional,
    such as emotional intelligence, managing the team’s well-being, mindfulness and self-empowerment.
    For the personnel of the sales and operation department, a “talent” programme was implemented,
    designed for a group of department heads and aimed at initiating a professional path towards the position
    of vice store manager. Thanks to an 8-month training, with webinars and team coaching directly at the
    store, participants gained more extensive knowledge of every department and worked on the technical and
    managerial skills connected to the role, with a special focus on leadership.
    The “New customer journey” initiative also continued, designed for all store employees who are constantly
    in contact with customers, to emphasise the key role customer experience now plays in the retail sector.

   EXCHANGE BETWEEN GENERATIONS
   Promoting an inclusive culture also means fostering and supporting the integration of the new
   generations, creating space for dialogue and exchange between the young talents hired by the
   Company and the more senior employees.
   In this connection, a tutorship programme designed for young graduates who are entering the world of
   work for the first time and a training course called “Exchange between generations” was launched, in which
   bosses and staff were able to reflect on the different generational targets and on how to better communicate
   and manage their relationship.

    with a strongly symbolic initiative: the Company
    placed a Red Bench in Pistoia, in the Oriana Fallaci

    near the Limito di Pioltello headquarters.
    In addition, on the same day, thanks to the partner-

    DIGITALISATION OF THE RECRUITMENT
    PROCESS
    Well before the health emergency, Esselunga had already
    started the digitalisation project of the recruitment process
    and this strategic choice turned out to be far-sighted when
    dealing with the new situation. Thanks to the digitalisation of
    tools, in fact, Esselunga’s recruitment processes continued
    even throughout the most critical stages of the emergency
    and the Talent Acquisition Centre Team was able to
    guarantee the necessary support to the business. The use of
    innovative technologies and artificial intelligence applied
    to a candidate video presentation system (which replaces
    the old paper CV) allows many more people to introduce
    themselves to the Company and improves the effectiveness
    and performance of the recruitment processes.

     THE CNR STUDY ON THE ABSORPTION OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS
     BY ESSELUNGA’S GREEN AREAS
     During 2020, the Institute for Bio-Economics of the CNR of Bologna updated the previous 2010 analytical
     study on the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) and on the removal of other atmospheric pollutants
     (O3, NO2, SO2, PM10) by the green areas of various Esselunga stores. The study focused on the analysis of
     8 company sites (DCs of Limito di Pioltello and Biandrate and stores of Lainate, Macherio, Piacenza Manfredi,
     Bologna Santa Viola, Stezzano and Varedo), by comparing the data measured previously in the same areas:
     this survey highlighted how the absorption capacity of the plants has grown over time. The study also
     took into account the environmental mitigation capability, typical of each plant species, which depends
     on intrinsic (physiology, development dynamics, etc.) as well as extrinsic factors (number), and estimated
     that during the course of 2020, thanks to the 8 green areas involved in the analysis, the plants absorbed,
     thereby removing from the atmosphere, 61.5 t of CO2 (+42% compared to 2010) and 319 kg of other
     atmospheric pollutants (+435% compared to 2010).

  Equivalent CO2 (CO2e) is a measure that expresses the impact on global warming of a certain amount of greenhouse gases compared to the same
amount of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is used to compare and combine the contributions of various greenhouse gases, in particular to estimate
the carbon footprint associated with a human activity.

In order to improve the energy efficiency and
decrease CO2e emissions, Esselunga has intro-
duced several technological innovations to its
processes and started up a number of projects.
The installation of two trigeneration plants at the
Parma and Biandrate sites are an example, as
they make it possible to self-produce electricity
and heat from natural gas.

                   In 2020 I was involved in a pilot project to extend and improve the current IT
                   system supporting restocking, which also aims to significantly reduce waste.
                   The contribution of analytics is embodied in advanced predictive models
                   to streamline the amounts of products for restocking the store shelves,
                   aiming at minimising unsold items. By reducing the waste of raw materials,
                   ingredients and surplus to the minimum, we contribute to environmental
                   sustainability. The implementation stage of the project in the near future
                   may result in a significant contribution to achieving our targets

    NATURAMA LINE – ETHICAL CERTIFICATION GLOBALG.A.P.5
    Esselunga has obtained the ethical certification according to the GlobalG.A.P standard (GRASP
    module) for certain items of the Naturama line including apples, bananas, clementines, trimmed
    green beans, new potatoes, peppers, Sardinian tomatoes and pomegranates. This certification
    attests to the good practices of individual farms thanks to careful assessment of the social risks.
    The product certification is also shown on the sale packages with the “Certified ethical” icon.
    THE FIGHT AGAINST ILLEGAL EMPLOYMENT
    Starting from 2015, Esselunga has promoted the registration of companies supplying fruit, vegetables and
    groceries, such as wine and oil, to the Network of High Quality Farm Work. Subsequently, it joined the mem-
    orandum of understanding, signed by FederDistribuzione, to foster a more transparent market and avoid bias
    effects in supply chain relations, setting up an in-company team to fight the illegal employment system with
    the aim of implementing an ethics-reputation assessment system in the agri-food sector.
    In 2020, the team’s activity completed the analysis and assessment of 300 companies in the wine sector,
    finding more than 20 suppliers registered with the Network of High Quality Farm Work, in addition to the 70
    already identified in 2019 in the fruit and vegetables sector. The goal in 2021 is to complete the analysis of sup-
    plying firms in the delicatessen sector and to extend it to dairy and charcuterie. In October 2020, following an
    awareness-raising initiative targeting suppliers, it was found that about 80% of companies, in possession of the
    requirements for registration, had submitted (or intended to submit) an application for joining the Network of
    High Quality Farm Work. As at 31 December 2020, the application of 30 of them had already been accepted,
    thus bringing to more than 100 the total membership of the Network by suppliers of products (branded and
    non-branded) in the agri-food sector.

     THE EXAMPLE OF FLOURS
     Various initiatives have been set up in recent years to replace the ingredients
     used for the branded products with 100% Italian origin ingredients.
     One example is the supply chain of the wheat processed to obtain the flour
     used at production facilities: as of 2020 the Company has implemented total
     control over all stages of harvesting and processing the raw material on the
     Italian territory, in order to be able to guarantee that 100% Italian origin
     flours are used at its production plants.

   THE TRENTINO RAINBOW TROUT AND THE PARTNERSHIP WITH
   ASTRO (TRENTINO ASSOCIATION OF TROUT FARMERS)
   Since the mid 90s, ASTRO (Trentino Association of Trout Farmers) has been supplying
   Esselunga with rainbow trout farmed in Trentino in clean and sanitised, well-ventilated
   and constantly monitored premises. The mountain waters in which the fish are farmed,
   in fact, are controlled through certified biological monitoring that protects them from
   sensitive alterations (biotic index). The Esselunga rainbow trout supplied by ASTRO
   complies with the sustainability criteria and is Sustainable Fishing certified.
   What is more, for twenty years now Esselunga has been cooperating with ASTRO
   on the Esselunga Naturama Rainbow Trout project. Following the strict technical
   regulations that govern the supply chain and traceability, the product is checked at every stage of growth
   and is Sustainable Fishing certified.
   The trout are fed properly and adequately; the feed formula is agreed beforehand with Esselunga and it
   is required to use solely raw materials of plant origin, with fish meal and oil and free of GMO (genetically
   modified organisms).
   This excellent product is also certified according to the principles of animal welfare. In fact, the farms
   adhere to high standards of animal and facility management, availability of adequate spaces, balanced and
   healthy food, high quality and hygiene of the premises, respecting the needs of the animals. In 2020, the
   Esselunga Naturama rainbow trout also obtained the certification of No antibiotics used at the farm.

   ELISENDA: THE ESSELUNGA ROSE
   In the spring of 2018, some new rose varieties selected by
   Kordes Rosen started being tested at the headquarters of
   Limito di Pioltello. After a three-year study, a specific variety
   was chosen, with beautiful flowers that can embody the
   elegance and sophistication of one of our brands: Elisenda.
   This rose belongs to the Floribunda group, i.e. modern,
   remontant roses, particularly suitable for creating mass
   effects. The colour ranges from red to yellow when in bud,
   then changing to an orange hue, to turn light apricot and
   pink when the flowers are open. It bears flowers repeatedly,
   from May to the autumn. The plant can reach one metre in
   height, if pruned with discernment.

LA SCALA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA
For three years now Esselunga has been a partner
of the Philharmonic Orchestra of the La Scala
theatre and supports the big Concerto for Milan,
which every year brings the symphonic music of
the most prestigious Italian orchestra to piazza
Duomo for free. Despite the pandemic, the
2020 concert was held on 13 September and was
a symbolic form of encouragement for the
entire country. Esselunga also supports “Open
Rehearsals”, an initiative thanks to which the magic
and prestige of Teatro alla Scala are the backdrop
for music to go hand in hand with social engagement
– making it possible to attend the rehearsals of the
Philharmonic while donating the proceeds to
children and young people from all over Italy who
are hospitalised at the main Milanese hospitals.

   GUSTOP
   Esselunga decided to support the Gustop project, carried out within “Milan Helps”, an
   initiative promoted by the Municipality of Milan. Gustop is a restaurant with a high social
   value in the south of Milan which, in addition to employing 10 people with disabilities,
   provides free meals to impoverished people or meals at controlled prices for other
   customers. With the COVID-19 emergency, as the restaurant premises could not be
   opened, the service turned into an actual take-away restaurant capable of delivering over 400 meals a day.
   The donation by Esselunga (worth 10,000 euros in foodstuff) allowed Gustop to support people in need.

    virtual mode: teachers and students connected to the streaming platform set up to follow the presentations
    either from school or from home. The students again had the opportunity to interact with prominent speakers

                   Consistently with our commitment to environmental protection, the Sustainability Report has
                   been printed in a limited number of copies using FSC® certified paper.
                   This certification guarantees that the paper supply chain is managed responsibly, in compliance
                   with strict environmental, social and economic standards.
                   Furthermore, to limit the number of printed pages, we have decided to provide the GRI Standard
                   concordance table, the so-called GRI Index, on the corporate website at
                   www.esselunga.it.
