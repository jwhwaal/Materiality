                                    17 Sustainable Development Goals to report on
                                    The internationally recognised sustainability agenda of the United Nations, with its seventeen Sustainable
                                    Development Goals (SDGs), forms a common global basis for tackling social challenges. They act as a driver for
                                    every public authority, organisation or individual wanting to do their bit to create a more sustainable world. The
                                    international consensus around the agenda, the goals and the language used makes it easier to combine forces
                                    in a targeted way and to make progress together, both locally and globally.
                                    Now more than ever, the common thread of the UN sustainability agenda takes on its full significance: Leave no
                                    one behind. The coronavirus crisis impacts all aspects of the seventeen goals and demonstrates the importance
                                    and absolute necessity to realise the Agenda 2030.
                                    At Colruyt Group, we are fully behind the SDG agenda. As of 2017, we are one of the ‘SDG Voices’ and will continue
                                    this commitment. As of January 2020, for this reason, we are a member of the Board of Directors of CIFAL Flanders.
              Measurement of impact
              With our products, services and initiatives, we want to create clearly identifiable sustainable added value.
              To measure and analyse our impact and draw up improvement plans, we always aim to apply science-based
              methodologies. For this reason, for several years, we have used footprint techniques such as PEF (Product
              Environmental Footprint) and OEF (Organisation Environmental Footprint). Via these techniques, we consider the
              whole life cycle of our own organisation and of our products, to gain an insight into the actual impact we have.
              Guided by these methodologies, we intend to use the insights gathered as input for the development of our strategy
              and objectives.

The operating profit (EBIT) totalled EUR 523 million or 5,3% of revenue in
2020/21. Excluding the gain realised on the contribution of Eoly Energy, the
EBIT margin was 5,0% of revenue (5,3% in 2019/20).
The share in the result of investments decreased to EUR -4 million in
2020/21 (EUR 52 million in 2019/20).
Virya Energy reported a result increase in the first semester and lower
results in the second semester, primarily due to one-off effects. In the
second half of 2019/20, Colruyt Group realised a one-off positive effect of
EUR 45 million from the contribution of Parkwind (off-shore wind energy)
into Virya Energy. The Fashion Society and Vendis Capital reported lower
results, mainly due to COVID-19. As of August 2020, The Fashion Society is
fully consolidated and no longer accounted for as a joint venture using the
equity method.
The effective tax rate amounted to 20,0% and was impacted by the reform
of the Belgian corporation tax, the investments in innovation and change
projects and the contribution of Eoly Energy.
The profit for the financial year totalled EUR 416 million (4,2% of revenue).
Excluding the gain realised on the contribution of Eoly Energy, the net
result equalled EUR 385 million or 3,9% of revenue in 2020/21 (EUR 380

               At the beginning of 2020, Colruyt and Studio 100 launched the cookery
               programme ‘De Pottenlikkers’, to make balanced eating more accessible
               to children. This co-creation could be viewed on colruyt.be and various
               Studio 100 channels, and was followed by a free holiday book and a
               cookery book. The 52 shows reached nearly a third of Belgian children
               aged between 6 and 12, many of whom had a go at cooking at home.

 On track for spectacular growth
 Collect&Go saw its revenue increase by more than 50% during the past
 financial year. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, the service
 has gained enormously in popularity. Existing customers ordered more
 frequently and in bigger volumes. They were joined by 140.000 new
 customers, one fifth of whom were not yet known to Colruyt Group. Net
 customer gains remained constantly at a high level.
 Customer satisfaction fluctuated depending on the availability of collection
 slots, but was far higher than before the coronavirus crisis by the end of
 the financial year.
 Due to the sudden influx of orders in March 2020, Collect&Go decided to
 cut activities to one third for a few weeks, in order to be able to guarantee

                    A well-balanced assortment
                    Colruyt has the right assortment for shopping every few days, and for bigger weekly shops. The neighbourhood
                    supermarkets also foster local connections and short supply chains, including via a growing range of regional products.
                    At the same time, attention is paid to logistical efficiency and simplicity of the assortment.
                    Colruyt actively works to make the assortment more sustainable, with respect for the environment, animal welfare, etc.
                    All stores have a butcher’s department, nearly all with service. The service counter has become smaller and self-
                    service with fresh pre-packed products larger.
                    Every year, five stores are given a ‘point chaud’ to bake off bread. When larger stores are refurbished, a hot bakery is
                    usually added.
Gondreville distribution centre
operational
• At the end of the financial year, Colruyt brought a brand new 12.000 m² distribution
  centre into service at Gondreville (near Nancy), mainly intended for fresh produce
  and fast-moving dry goods. Around a third of all Colruyt stores, mostly in the Grand
  Est region, are supplied from Gondreville. The first deliveries took place in mid-April
  and the site was 100% operational from mid-May.
• The new site reduces transport times and makes supplying stores more efficient and
  eco-friendly.
• Planning permission has also been applied for the construction of a new
  headquarters and 25.000 m² distribution centre near Dôle. Colruyt plans to bring this
  site into service in mid-2023.
• Overall, logistical capacity will double by 2023, enabling the further expansion of the
  store estate.

Strong performance
• Bike Republic has had a strong financial year. While the stores were
  closed for two months from mid-March 2020, online sales enjoyed
  a substantial boost. The company accelerated the development of
  services such as remote selling, live chat, home delivery of new and
  refurbished bikes and home repair service. As a result, it still managed
  to achieve a substantial amount of the planned revenue during the
  first lockdown. During the subsequent lockdowns, customers could use
  the Click&Collect service: reserve online and collect from the store or
  have it delivered to their home.
• Bike Republic benefitted from the rediscovery of cycling by the general
  public, for both recreation and commuting. By the summer of 2020,                                New name, concept and story

Recipe for success
• Last financial year, 5 Spar stores underwent a total remodelling, often

  management) also receive the Colruyt Group signature on the front.
• The profitability of the Spar storekeepers remains among the best in the
  market. The new and remodelled Spar Colruyt Group stores in particular are
  recording above-average results, which inspires RPCG and the storekeepers
  to accelerate the renovation process. By the end of the financial year, 45

 store (once again) for meeting their basic needs, and the contact with the local
 shopkeeper.

Eurowatt SA is a European independent electricity producer based in
Luxembourg, mainly active in onshore wind activities in France since 1994. The
company also has onshore wind assets in Poland and Portugal and small-scale
hydroelectric plants in Portugal and Spain. Eurowatt operates a total capacity
of 470 MW, installed and under construction, across thirty sites, besides 300 MW
in various stages of development.
Korys acquired 51% of Eurowatt’s shares in 2014 and transferred this majority stake to Virya Energy at
the beginning of 2019. At the end of February 2021, Virya Energy acquired the remaining 49% from the
minority shareholders and the management, becoming the 100% owner of Eurowatt.
In 2020, the wind farms managed by Eurowatt produced a total of more than 900 GWh, partly thanks to
exceptionally favourable wind conditions in the first and last quarters of the year.

Transition to service-oriented working
In the last two years, BP&S has transformed into a service-oriented organisation
that responds efficiently and agilely to the needs of its partners and shields them
from the underlying complexity. Thirty former departments have turned into service
centres, with clearly defined services, roles, responsibilities and arrangements with
the partners. This new way of working requires effort and flexibility on the part of
employees, but also gives them greater responsibility and autonomy. This results
in more service-mindedness throughout the organisation, a greater sense of initiative
and a higher level of service.

Remuneration: more than just a wage
In addition to a market wage, we set great store by allowing our employees to reap the financial rewards of
the company’s growth and enabling them to participate in our business. We do this by distributing part of the
profits in the form of profit sharing and by allowing our employees to subscribe to the annual capital increases
on preferential terms.

3. Working conditions in the supply chain
As an international market player, we take responsibility for ensuring the
right working conditions at our producers. We ask all suppliers of private
label products to sign up to the amfori BSCI Code of Conduct. This contains
universal human rights principles that must be respected. Compliance with the
code of conduct is monitored via certificates, social initiatives and/or social
audits. If the business partner needs support, we explore together how we can
make improvements. If the will is lacking to create good working conditions,
we will end the partnership.
                                                                  RESULTS
   Engage with suppliers
   • We use the amfori BSCI Code of Conduct as a benchmark for all
     suppliers of our private label products.
   • Our code of conduct endorses universal principles of international
     human rights agreements which must be respected, in relation to
     minimum age for employees, right to fair wages, exclusion of child and
     forced labour, guarantee of safe and healthy working conditions, ban
     on discrimination, etc.
   Examine working conditions
   • Working conditions at 97 producers were audited in 2020.
   • 95% of our producers in at-risk countries provide good working
     conditions or are willing to make improvements. We continue to work
     to bring this up to 100%.

where we try to reuse or recycle each raw material at
the highest possible level.

                                             The Eco-Score is similar to the Nutri-Score: products are given a letter and colour code

                                             therefore indicate whether the food has a low or high ecological impact. This impact is
                                             measured partly using the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology, along
                                             with several other environmental impact categories such as water or energy consumption.
                                             Other aspects taken into account include sustainability labels, packaging, origin and

9. Goodwill
The recognised goodwill relates mainly to goodwill arising from the acquisition of complete business entities. For more information regarding the definition, recognition and valuation
of goodwill we refer to note 1. Significant accounting policies within this current financial report.
As described in the principles, goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment at the level of the cash-generating unit (CGU). Colruyt Group considers the business
segments or the business entities as CGUs. The impairment test of goodwill consists of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill,
and an impairment is recognised if the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount. Given the recent acquisition of The Fashion Society NV, the latter has not been included
in the impairment tests for the current financial year.
The recoverable amount of each business unit is the value in use or, if higher, the fair value less costs to sell. When preparing cash flow forecasts, Colruyt Group uses estimated growth
rates and expected future margins derived from the actual figures of the most recent financial year and forecasts for a period of 5 to 10 years. The growth rates take into account
expected inflation and do not include non-organic growth. Given the importance of these operational parameters for the calculation of the value in use, they are monitored closely at a
central level through alignment and validation processes and, when determining them, external information sources are used.
To determine the discount rate, Colruyt Group uses the ‘Capital Asset Pricing Model’. The following components were used in this model for the present reporting period: a 'Risk-Free
Interest Rate' of 0% to 1% (0% to 1% in the previous reporting period), a 'Market Risk Premium' of 6% to 7% (6% to 7% in the previous reporting period) and an unlevered Beta of 0,4 (0,5
in the previous reporting period). For Colruyt Group this resulted in a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for its two main operating segments of between 2,5% and 4,0% (between
3,3% and 4,7% in the previous reporting period). The discount rates are reviewed at least annually.
Colruyt Group uses assumptions adapted to the characteristics of the different underlying cash-generating units. For the main cash-generating units Colruyt Group uses the following
expected average revenue growth percentages for the next 5 to 10 years:
• operating segment ‘Retail’: 1% on average (1% on average in the previous reporting period);
• operating segment ‘Wholesale and Foodservice’: 4% on average (2% on average in the previous reporting period).
To determine the residual value using the discounted cash flow method, the ‘Gordon growth model’ was used. The share of discounted residual value is within a range of 70% and 85%
of the calculated value in use. The impairment tests were performed in February 2021.
The management is of the opinion that the assumptions as described above, used for calculating the value in use, provide the best estimation of future developments. When
performing the calculation using a terminal growth percentage of 0% (instead of 1%) in the calculation or a WACC of 8%, this does not have a substantial influence on the global
outcome of the calculation. As a result the conclusions regarding the impairment test on all cash-generating units remain unchanged.
Goodwill by cash-generating unit can be presented as follows:

(1) The adjustments for Colruyt Group can mainly be explained by the fact that Colruyt Group recognises the Parkwind entities within Virya Energy NV at historical value.
    In addition, effects in the consolidated figures of Virya Energy NV resulting from a change in the consolidation method of the underlying entities, are offset by Colruyt Group as they are not applicable to Colruyt Group.
(2) Since Virya Energy NV was incorporated only at the end of financial year 2019/20, for the financial year 2019/20 only the balance sheet positions have been included in the table above.

The investments in joint ventures for the financial year 2020/21 consist of the non-quoted entities Achilles Design BV (24,70%), Kriket BV (24,81%), Daltix NV and Daltix Unipessoal
LDA (64,75%), We Connect Data BV (16,03%) and Ticom NV (90,0%). As Colruyt Group shares the control over these entities with other parties, these joint ventures are included in the
consolidated financial statements using the equity method.
During the financial year, interests were acquired in Kriket BV (April 2020), Daltix NV and Daltix Unipessoal LDA (June 2020) and We Connect Data BV (August 2020). The interest in Ticom
NV was increased (November 2020), as a result of which this company is now also included as a joint venture using the equity method.
On 3 September 2020, Colruyt Group increased its stake in Fraluc from 68% to more than 96%. Since 1 August 2020, the participation held in Fraluc has been fully consolidated as
a subsidiary, whereas for the first 4 months of the financial year, it was accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method. In the course of the financial year, further minority
shareholdings were acquired, bringing Colruyt Group’s share to 98%. In March 2021, the company was renamed The Fashion Society NV.
The participation in Trybou Bio BV was previously accounted for using the equity method, but after exercising a call option in February 2021. Colruyt Group is now the sole shareholder,
and this participation is therefore fully consolidated at 31 March 2021. Since the transaction took place at the end of the financial year, the result for the financial year was still
accounted for using the equity method.
The balance sheet of Parkwind NV was not included in the note on material joint ventures for the financial year 2019/20, since Parkwind NV was accounted for via Virya Energy NV at
the end of last financial year. The result of Parkwind NV (60,13%) was, however, still included for the full financial year 2019/20 as the contribution to Virya Energy NV took place at the
end of that financial year.
The investments in The Fashion Society NV, Kriket BV, Daltix NV en Daltix Unipessoal LDA, Ticom NV and Trybou Bio BV are presented in the ‘Retail’ operating segment and the
investment in Achilles Design BV is presented in the ‘Other activities’ operating segment.
These companies have their main activities in Belgium.
The consolidated figures of the material joint ventures are as follows:

The financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income consist mainly of investments in the holding companies Sofindev III NV (10,88%) and Sofindev IV NV (9,42%), the
investment in North Sea Wind CV (7,18%) and the holdings in investment funds Good Harvest Belgium I SRL (1,13%) and Blue Horizon Ventures I SCSp RAIF (1,09%). The investments in
the various companies are measured at fair value, calculated as the share of Colruyt Group in the equity of these companies, corrected, in the case of the investment funds, for the fair
value of their own investment portfolios.
The financial assets at fair value through profit and loss mainly consist of convertible bonds (EUR 95,0 million) issued by the associate Virya Energy NV. This compound instrument was
drawn down in two tranches (the first in June 2020 and the second in January 2021) and which will both mature in June 2022. Colruyt Group subscribed to 792.023 bonds (1.301.213
bonds in all were issued by Virya Energy NV). If Virya Energy NV opts not to prematurely redeem the convertible bonds, Colruyt Group has the option to convert its bonds into shares of
Virya Energy NV at a predetermined conversion price at maturity date. This financial instrument was recognised by Colruyt Group as a financial asset at the conversion price and reflects
the fair value on 31 March 2021. The market conformity of the parameters of this financial instrument was determined by an independent external party.
During the current reporting period the non-current financial assets increased by a net amount of EUR 97,1 million. This is mainly explained by the subscription to the convertible
bonds of Virya Energy NV at a conversion value of EUR 95,0 million, the initial recognition of the holdings in the investment funds Good Harvest Belgium I SRL and Blue Horizon
Ventures I SCSp RAIF in a total amount of EUR 2,9 million, a fair value adjustment for Sofindev IV NV of EUR 2,8 million and a net capital movement for Sofindev IV NV of
EUR -3,1 million.
During the previous reporting period the non-current financial assets increased by EUR 5,6 million. This is explained mainly by a paying-up of the capital of EUR 2,0 million in Sofindev
IV NV and by fair value adjustments at Sofindev III NV and Sofindev IV NV in a total amount of EUR 2,4 million. In addition, the capital increase of North Sea Wind CV was subscribed to
in an amount of EUR 1,1 million.

The equity instruments and fixed-income securities at fair value through profit or loss relate mainly to financial assets held by the Luxembourg reinsurance company Locré SA
(EUR 27,0 million for the current period). The financial assets at amortised cost relate to a term deposit held by Colruyt IT Consultancy India Private Limited. The derivative financial
instruments relate mainly to the fair value of the inflation swap contract for hedging future wage increases due to inflation and the outstanding currency hedges for cash flow hedging
purposes.
The equity instruments and fixed-income securities are measured at their closing rates on 31 March 2021.
Fair value adjustments are recognised through profit or loss. The return on the fixed-income securities is 0,9% on average, with a maximum of 4,9%. The maturities of these
investments vary between 5 and 30 years, with an average maturity of 10 years.
The cash flow hedging instruments are measured at their fair value at 31 March 2021. Fair value adjustments are accounted for through other comprehensive income owing to the
classification as hedge accounting.
More information on Colruyt Group’s risk management approach to investments can be found in note 27. Risk management.
Fair value adjustments to the current assets as at 31 March 2021 resulted in a net gain of EUR 2,7 million for the current financial year (compared to a net loss of EUR 1,3 million
for the financial year 2019/20).

15. Business combinations
On 3 September 2020, Colruyt Group increased its stake in The Fashion Society (formerly Fraluc) from 68% to more than 96%. The Fashion Society NV is the holding company that
comprises the fashion retail chains ZEB, PointCarré, The Fashion Store and ZEB For Stars. The Belgian Competition Authority (BMA) authorised this transaction on 24 November. Since
1 August 2020, the stake held in The Fashion Society Group has been fully consolidated for as a subsidiary and no longer accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method. The
transaction resulted in goodwill of EUR 22,3 million. In determining this goodwill, a conditional variable compensation was applied, with the most accurate estimate possible of the
amount to be finally calculated at the end of the valuation period. This recalculation may result in the adjustment of the already recognised goodwill. In the course of the financial year
2020/21, further minority shareholdings were acquired, bringing Colruyt Group’s share to 98%.
The acquisition balance sheet of The Fashion Society can be summarised as follows:

On 31 March 2021 Colruyt Group did not recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities in an amount of EUR 75,1 million (EUR 72,5 million on 31 March 2020). This amount relates to
temporary differences as well as tax losses and unused tax credits carried forward in a total amount of EUR 289,4 million (EUR 252,1 million in financial year 2019/20) of which EUR
284,3 million can be carried forward indefinitely to future reporting periods (EUR 247,5 million in financial year 2019/20).
Colruyt Group only recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits
can be utilised. Colruyt Group sets a time horizon of five years for these estimates.

18. Inventories
Inventories mainly represent trade goods. The accumulated impairment on inventories of trade goods amounted to EUR 58,2 million in the current financial year compared to
EUR 4,8 million in the previous financial year. The increase is largely due to the fact that Colruyt Group made the necessary provisions for COVID-19-related inventory risks.
The amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the 2020/21 income statement amounts to EUR 7.138,8 million and was reported under ‘Cost of goods sold’. Last year this
expense was EUR 7.016,2 million.

21. Equity
21.1. Capital management
Colruyt Group’s aim in managing its equity is to maintain a healthy financial structure with a minimal dependency on external financing as well as to create shareholder’s value. The
Board of Directors strives to at least increase the annual dividend per share in proportion to the increase in group profit. The pay-out ratio for this financial year is 48,0%(1). According
to the bylaws, at least 90% of the distributable profits are reserved for shareholders and a maximum of 10% can be reserved for the directors. Furthermore, Colruyt Group seeks to
increase shareholders’ value by purchasing treasury shares. The Board of Directors was authorised by the Extraordinary General Meeting of 10 October 2019 to acquire up to 27.610.418
of the company’s treasury shares. This authorisation is valid for a period of five years. As employee commitment to the group’s growth is also one of Colruyt Group’s priorities, an
annual capital increase reserved for employees has been organised since 1987.
(1) More details can be found under note 21.4 Dividends.
21.2. Share capital
As a result of the resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on 8 October 2020 the capital was increased by 222.372 shares; the related capital increase
amounted to EUR 10,3 million.
The Company’s share capital on 31 March 2021 amounted to EUR 357,4 million divided into 136.154.960 fully paid up ordinary shares without par value. All shares, except treasury
shares, participate in the profits.
The Board of Directors is authorised to increase the share capital in one or more instalments by a total amount of EUR 315,0 million, within the limits of the authorised capital.
Capital increases undertaken under this authorisation may be by contribution in cash or kind, conversion of any reserves or issue of convertible bonds, and can be organised in any
way compliant with legal prescriptions. The conditions of the capital increases undertaken under this authorisation, and the rights and obligations attached to the new shares are
determined by the Board of Directors, taking into account the legal prescriptions.
This authorisation is valid for a period of three years starting from the day of the publication of the authorisation granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders in the
Annexes to the Belgian Official Gazette. This authorisation can be extended one or more times, each time for a maximum period of five years, by means of a decision of the General
Meeting of Shareholders, deliberating according to the guidelines that apply for changes in bylaws. The current authorisation will end in October 2021.
21.3. Treasury shares
Treasury shares are recognised at the cost of the treasury shares purchased. On 31 March 2021 Colruyt Group held 1.368.388 treasury shares, representing 1,02% of the shares issued at
reporting date. We refer to the Corporate Governance section for more details on the purchase of treasury shares.
By notarial deed of 8 October 2020 the Board of Directors of Etn. Fr. Colruyt NV cancelled 2.500.000 of the purchased treasury shares.
21.4. Dividends
On 11 June 2021 a gross dividend of EUR 197,5 million or EUR 1,47 per share was proposed by the Board of Directors. In the previous financial year the gross dividend amounted to
EUR 183,1 million or EUR 1,35 per share. The gross dividend takes into account the number of treasury shares purchased up until 11 June 2021. The dividend was not incorporated in
the consolidated financial statements for financial year 2020/21.

Colruyt Group offers various types of post-employment benefits. These include retirement benefit plans and other arrangements in respect of post-employment benefits. In accordance
with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the post-employment benefits are subdivided into either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.
24.1. Defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return
In Belgium, the Law regarding supplementary pensions (‘WAP’) requires employers to guarantee a minimum return on defined contribution plans over the course of the career. For
amounts until 31 December 2015 this minimum return was 3,25% on the employer contributions and 3,75% on employee contributions. As a result of a law change in December 2015,
the interest rate to be guaranteed is variable starting from 1 January 2016, based on a mechanism linked to the return of the Belgian OLO bond with a minimum of 1,75% and
 a maximum of 3,75%. Since 2016 the minimum return has been 1,75%.
Owing to these legal changes, and also to the fact that a clear position was taken by the regulatory instances during 2016, and given that reliable estimates can be made for these
retirement benefit plans, the Belgian defined contribution plans are considered as defined benefit plans since financial year 2016/17. They are measured in accordance with IAS 19
based on the ‘projected unit credit’ method.
The amount resulting from the group’s liabilities related to its defined contribution plans with a legally guaranteed minimum return, as recorded in the consolidated statement of
financial position, is as follows:

• price inflation: 1,80% (same as for previous financial year);
• salary inflation: 2,30% (same as for previous financial year).
Description of the main risks
Colruyt Group is exposed by its defined benefit plans to a number of risks, of which the most important ones are explained below:
Volatility of plan assets - investment risk
The retirement benefit liabilities are calculated using a discount rate determined by prime company returns. In the event the plan assets do not reach this level of return, the defined
benefit liabilities on account of Colruyt Group may increase. Colruyt Group reduces the investment risk by investing in insurance contracts instead of equity instruments.
Interest risk
A decrease in returns will increase the retirement benefit liabilities, however this will be partly compensated by an increase in value of bonds held by the retirement benefit plans.
Life expectancy
The retirement benefit liabilities mainly concern benefits that are provided to the participant during his or her lifetime. An increase in life expectancy will therefore lead to an increase
in retirement benefit liabilities.
Salary expectancy
The fair value of retirement benefit liabilities is calculated based on the current and estimated future salary of the participants in the retirement benefit plans. As a result an increase in
salary of the participants in the retirement benefit plan will lead to an increase in the retirement benefit liabilities.

The possibility to retire early, as it exists within Colruyt Group for employees of its Belgian entities, is based on the ‘Unemployment regime with company supplement’ applicable in
Belgium. The accounting principles in respect of the liabilities and costs related to this system are included under note 1.4. Other significant accounting policies.
Colruyt Group regularly reviews the long-term assumptions in respect of these liabilities. For this financial year the following assumptions were used:
• discount rate: 1,20% compared to 1,80% for the previous financial year;
• salary inflation: 2,30% (same as for previous financial year).
The weighted average duration of the liability for benefits under the ‘Unemployment regime with company supplement’ is 15,78 years, as compared to 17,20 years in the previous year.

For the long-service benefits (Belgian entities), Colruyt Group uses the following parameters:
• discount rate: 1,10% compared to 1,75% for previous financial year;
• salary inflation: 2,30% (same as previous financial year).
For the legally established benefits, the following parameters are used:
French entities:
• discount rate: 1,15% compared to 1,75% for previous financial year;
• salary inflation: 1,75% (same as for previous financial year).
Indian entities:
• discount rate: 6,80% (same as for previous financial year);
• salary inflation: 10,00% (same as for previous financial year).

The above are purely hypothetical changes in individual assumptions, keeping all other assumptions unchanged: economic factors and their changes will often impact more than one
assumption at a time and the impact of changes in assumptions is not linear. As a result, the information above does not necessarily provide a reasonable reflection of future results.

short-term financing and the full consolidation of The Fashion Society.

27. Risk management
27.1. Risks related to financial instruments
A. Currency risk
Colruyt Group’s operational entities are located in the euro zone, except for the activities in India, Hong Kong and Africa.
The exchange rate risk incurred when consolidating revenues and costs of subsidiaries not reporting in euro is not hedged.
In addition, Colruyt Group incurs a transactional currency risk on purchases in foreign currency. Colruyt Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to this type of
currency risk and to certain inflation risks, with no speculative purposes.
Exchange results incurred when settling purchase transactions in foreign currencies are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Colruyt Group’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is based on the following positions in foreign currencies:
                                                                                                                                                               Net position
  (in million EUR)                                                                                                                                         31.03.21          31.03.20
  EUR/INR                                                                                                                                                         0,9               0,4

The net positions per currency are presented before intra-group eliminations. A positive amount implies that entities of Colruyt Group have a net receivable in the first currency. The
second currency of the pair is the functional currency of the Colruyt Group entity concerned.
The impact of exchange rate changes compared to the euro is relatively limited.
B. Interest rate risk
Given the limited size of non-current borrowings and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position, Colruyt Group does not hedge its interest rate risk.
On 31 March 2021 the total amount of bank and other borrowings was EUR 221,2 million (non-current and current) or 4,3% of the balance sheet total (EUR 7,1 million on 31 March
2020) and 78,1% of the net cash and cash equivalents. In 2020/21 the Group withdrew EUR 176,7 million of short-term financing, whereas no short term financing was withdrawn in
2019/20. Most of these borrowings are at a fixed interest rate.
Colruyt Group’s lease liabilities amount to EUR 242,8 million in the current financial year, as against just EUR 158,3 million in the previous financial year. The increase in the lease
liabilities is mainly explained by the full consolidation of The Fashion Society NV as from financial year 2020/21. The lease liabilities are recognised under IFRS 16 with a fixed interest
rate.
A change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated income statement or on future cash flows of Colruyt Group.
         FINANCIAL REPORT | Consolidated statements • Statement • Independent auditor’s report • Notes • Definitions                                                                         270

C. Credit risk
The credit risk in relation to trade receivables is limited since most of the retail customers of Colruyt Group pay cash. The main part of Colruyt Group’s receivables is linked with
the wholesale activity for which Colruyt Group applies payment terms that are common in the industry. Risks are mainly limited by the regular follow-up of the credit rating of the
wholesale customers and the independent storekeepers to which goods or services are delivered. If necessary, Colruyt Group requires bank guarantees. The credit risk is spread
amongst a relatively large number of customers. Solucious NV has covered its credit risk by taking out credit insurance.
Certain customers provide off-balance sheet bank guarantees in order to secure the collectability of Colruyt Group’s receivables on them. For the current reporting period non-
recognised bank guarantees were received from several customers having total outstanding debts of EUR 29,6 million (compared to EUR 34,4 million for the previous reporting period).
The collectability of this amount was secured by bank guarantees for an amount of EUR 24,9 million (compared to EUR 28,0 million for the previous reporting period).
For the calculation of the expected credit losses under IFRS 9 ’Financial Instruments’, Colruyt Group applies the following approaches:
- the simplified approach based on a provision matrix; and
- the general method, under which credit losses are determined at the level of the individual receivable.
The choice depends on specific circumstances.
D. Liquidity risk
Finco NV and Finco France SAS are Colruyt Group’s financial coordinators, and ensure that all entities of Colruyt Group have access to the financial resources they need. Finco NV and
Finco France SAS apply a cash pooling system, i.e. any excess in cash and cash equivalents within entities of the group is used for shortages in other entities of the group. Finco NV
and Finco France SAS are also responsible for the investment of Colruyt Group’s cash and cash equivalents. Finco NV and Finco France SAS use cash projections to follow up on Colruyt
Group’s liquidity. Over the past few years Colruyt Group has made very limited use of any form of external financing.
E. Other market risks
Colruyt Group’s reinsurance entity, Locré SA, manages a portfolio of financial instruments (fixed interest-bearing instruments and equity instruments). These are used to cover
the reinsurance risk. At 31 March 2021 the total value of Colruyt Group’s current financial assets amount to EUR 36,4 million (EUR 27,8 million per 31 March 2020); of which
EUR 27,0 million is part of the investment portfolio of Locré SA (EUR 23,3 million as per 31 March 2020). Fluctuations in market values and other market parameters of these
instruments can therefore have an impact on Colruyt Group’s financial result. In total, Colruyt Group recognised a net upward revaluation of EUR 2,7 million during this financial year (a
net write-off of EUR -1,3 million during the previous reporting period).
The ratio of the current investment portfolio to net cash and cash equivalents of Colruyt Group amounts to 12,8% (10,6% for the previous reporting period).
F. Financial assets and liabilities per category and per class
In accordance with IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, financial instruments measured at fair value are classified using a fair value
hierarchy.

The fair value hierarchy is based on the inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities at measurement date. The following three levels are distinguished:
• Level 1: inputs used for measurement of fair value are officially quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: the fair value of financial instruments not traded on an active market is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques use inputs of observable market prices,
  if available, as much as possible and avoid reliance on entity-specific estimations.
• Level 3: financial instruments for which fair value is determined with valuation techniques using certain parameters not based on observable market data.
For the amounts recognised at ‘Amortised cost’ we can conclude that the carrying amount equals the fair value in most cases due to the nature of the instrument or
due to the short-term character. Those cases whereby the amortised cost deviates from the fair value are not material.
For the amounts measured at fair value we refer to note 14. Financial assets, which describes how the fair value is measured.
On 12 June 2020, Colruyt Group subscribed to a first tranche of convertible bonds with a 24-month maturity, issued by the associate Virya Energy NV in an amount of EUR 63,9 million.
On 15 January 2021, this amount was increased to EUR 97,4 million with the subscription of a second tranche of convertible bonds with the same maturity date as the first tranche
(12 June 2022). The carrying amount of EUR 95,0 million corresponds to the conversion price and reflects the fair value at 31 March 2021. This compound instrument is measured at
fair value and included in the category 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss'.
The financial assets classified under level 3, include, in addition to the Virya Energy NV convertible bonds, amongst others the investments in the holding company Sofindev IV NV, in
the investment funds Good Harvest Belgium I SRL and Blue Horizon Ventures I SCSp RAIF and in North Sea Wind CV, in which Colruyt Group does not have a significant influence.
The opening and closing balance of the investments classified under level 3 can be reconciled as follows:

27.2. Other risks
A. COVID-19 health crisis
From the end of financial year 2019/20 onwards, Colruyt Group has experienced diverse impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis. Certain income statement items (notably revenue, gross
profit, services and miscellaneous goods, employee benefit expenses and share in the result of investments) were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19 impact,
however, could not be isolated in an unambiguous manner.
The food stores processed higher volumes, which positively influenced revenue at the end of 2019/20 and in 2020/21. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, all non-essential stores in
Belgium, including the group's non-food stores (Dreamland, Dreambaby, The Fashion Society NV and Bike Republic), were required to temporarily close (from 18 March to 10 May 2020,
as well as in November 2020). The government-enforced closure of all hospitality businesses in Belgium resulted in a revenue decrease at Solucious NV. Volumes of the DATS 24 NV
filling stations also declined as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
         FINANCIAL REPORT | Consolidated statements • Statement • Independent auditor’s report • Notes • Definitions                                                                   273

In order to meet the higher volumes, Colruyt Group strengthened its food stores, and its logistics and production departments with both internal and external employees. As a token
of gratitude for the efforts made, Colruyt Group also granted additional compensation and leave days to its employees. The group continues to implement measures at all its sites to
protect the health and safety of all those present and to ensure the continuity of the operations. The costs related to the increased activities and the measures implemented were
included in the income statement for the financial year 2020/21. Colruyt Group has set up provisions to cover COVID-19 related inventory risks as well as other risks and costs.
Thanks to the group’s risk management system, continuity and other risks are being monitored on a regular basis, both in the subsidiaries and in the companies in which Colruyt Group
has an interest. To date, the group has no knowledge of information that would lead to a material adjustment of the results or the notes thereto.
B. Other
Colruyt Group is further exposed to various other risks that are not necessarily financial in nature, but nevertheless have the potential to impact Colruyt Group’s financial position. For a
description of risks other than the ones mentioned above and of how Colruyt Group manages its exposure to these risks, we refer to the Corporate Governance section. In this respect,
we also refer to the Audit Committee, which regularly discusses the risk reports of the Risk Management department (internal audit).
28. Off-balance sheet rights and commitments
Colruyt Group has a number of commitments which are not recognised in the statement of financial position. These are mainly contractual obligations related to future acquisitions of
property, plant and equipment and future purchases of goods and services.
The amounts due in respect of these commitments are as follows:
  (in million EUR)                                                                                                   31.03.21          < 1 year         1-5 years         > 5 years

(1) Leases outside the scope of IFRS 16.
The off-balance sheet commitments for lease arrangements in a lessee capacity amount to EUR 4,1 million (EUR 2,7 million at 31 March 2020) and relate to short-term leases or leases
of low-value assets. In addition, these off-balance sheet commitments also contain arrangements that do not meet the definition of a lease.
The income statement includes rental and rental-related charges in respect of movables in the amount of EUR 18,7 million (EUR 15,8 million for the previous reporting period). These
rental charges mainly result from cancellable lease arrangements that do not meet the definition of a lease.
The commitments relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment for an amount of EUR 64,5 million (EUR 58,4 million in the previous reporting period) consist mainly of
contractual commitments for the acquisition of land and buildings.
          FINANCIAL REPORT | Consolidated statements • Statement • Independent auditor’s report • Notes • Definitions                                                                         274

The commitments relating to purchases of goods for an amount of EUR 191,0 million (EUR 146,3 million in the previous reporting period) are the result of forward contracts concluded
with suppliers in order for Colruyt Group to ensure the sufficient supply of certain trade goods, as well as of purchase commitments in respect of electricity and green certificates, and
the commitments by The Fashion Society NV to purchase clothing collections.
‘Other commitments’ include commitments resulting from various non-cancellable forward contracts regarding ICT services (mainly for software maintenance and development) for an
amount of EUR 19,9 million (EUR 22,2 million in the previous reporting period).
In addition to these commitments Colruyt Group also has certain rights which are not recognised in the statement of financial position. Occasionally Colruyt Group leases out certain
immovable assets under lease arrangements.
The amounts to be received in relation to these rights are to be classified as follows:
  (in million EUR)                                                                                                   31.03.21       < 1 year          1-5 years          > 5 years
  Lease arrangements as lessor                                                                                             7,6            4,3                 3,3                  -

  Lease arrangements as lessor                                                                                             7,5            4,0                 3,5                  -
The off-balance sheet commitments for lease arrangements amount to EUR 7,6 million (EUR 7,5 million as per 31 March 2020) and mainly relate to operating lease arrangements as
lessor in respect of subleased assets.
The rights resulting from non-cancellable agreements in respect of movables are not material.

29. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are all those items in relation to third parties which are not recognised in the statement of financial position, in accordance with
IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’.
The table below gives an overview of all contingent liabilities of Colruyt Group.
 (in million EUR)                                                                                                                                         31.03.21            31.03.20
 Disputes                                                                                                                                                        1,9               6,6
 Other                                                                                                                                                           0,6               0,1
At balance sheet date there were a limited number of legal actions outstanding against Colruyt Group which, although disputed, constitute a contingent liability of EUR 1,9 million
(compared to EUR 6,6 million in the previous reporting period). The pending cases primarily concern commercial law claims.
As was the case last year, there are no contingent liabilities for pending cases in respect of taxation law, common law or social law. ‘Other’ contingent liabilities represent guarantees
provided by Colruyt Group towards financial institutions. These guarantees consist of buyback commitments supplied as an additional guarantee for the financing of affiliated
independent storekeepers for an amount of EUR 0,6 million (compared to EUR 0,1 million in the previous reporting period).
When acquiring interests and determining goodwill, a conditional variable compensation is applied, with the most accurate estimate possible of the amount to be finally calculated at
the end of the valuation period.
Colruyt Group expects no significant financial disadvantages to be derived from these liabilities.
There are no material contingent assets to be reported.
30. Dividends paid and proposed
On 6 October 2020 a gross dividend of EUR 1,35 per share was paid to the shareholders.
For the financial year 2020/21, the Board of Directors has proposed a gross dividend of EUR 1,47 per share, which will be declared payable from 5 October 2021. As the decision to

34.5. Changes in consolidation scope
a. a. New investments
On 19 August 2020, 100% of the shares of Joos Hybrid NV were acquired. Joos Hybrid NV provides hybrid total solutions for document and communication management. Joos Hybrid NV
has been fully consolidated as a subsidiary since 1 August 2020. In December 2020, the company was renamed Symeta Hybrid NV.
On 16 September 2020, the shares of Izock BV were acquired in full with a view to ensuring the continuity of the operation of the store.
The companies Saro BV (May 2020) and Onroerende Beleggingsmaatschappij van Brabant NV and Bavingsveld NV (both December 2020) were also fully acquired.
During the financial year, interests were also acquired in Kriket BV (April 2020), Daltix NV and Daltix Unipessoal LDA (June 2020) and We Connect Data BV (August 2020). In November
2020, the interest in Ticom NV was increased. These companies are now accounted for as joint ventures using the equity method.
b. Mergers
With effect from 1 April 2020, the companies Thudiwash BV, Driesen Zelfbediening BV, Drongen Motors BV and Sin Invest BV merged with Colim NV.
c. Newly established companies
In Belgium, the companies Witeb 4 BV (May 2020), Codevco VII BV and Codevco VIII NV (December 2020) and Witeb 5 BV (January 2021) were established. In Senegal, the company
Colruyt Afrique SAS was founded (May 2020).
d. Other changes
On 25 May 2020, Colruyt Group contributed certain assets related to the renewable wind energy activities of Eoly NV to the energy holding company Virya Energy NV, as a result of which
Colruyt Group's share in Virya Energy NV increased to 61%.
In April 2020, the energy holding company Virya Energy NV signed an agreement with Participatiemaatschappij Vlaanderen (PMV) to increase its stake in Parkwind NV to 100%. As part
of the agreement, PMV also acquired a minority stake in Arcadis Ost 1, a German wind farm being developed by Parkwind NV in the Baltic Sea. Closing of the transaction occurred in
June 2020.
In February 2021, Virya Energy NV bought out the minority shareholders of Eurowatt Group, thus acquiring 100% of the shares and full control of Eurowatt Group.
On 3 September 2020, Colruyt Group increased its stake in Fraluc from 68% to more than 96%. Fraluc NV is the holding company that includes the fashion retail chains ZEB, PointCarré,
The Fashion Store and ZEB For Stars. The Belgian Competition Authority (BMA) authorised this transaction on 24 November. Since 1 August 2020, stake held in The Fraluc has been fully
consolidated as a subsidiary and is no longer accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method. The transaction resulted in goodwill of EUR 22,3 million. In determining this
goodwill, a conditional variable compensation was applied, with the most accurate estimate possible of the amount to be finally calculated at the end of the measurement period. This
recalculation may result in the adjustment of the already recognised goodwill. In the course of the financial year, further minority shareholdings were acquired, bringing Colruyt Group’s
share to 98%. In March 2021, the company was renamed The Fashion Society NV.
The stake in Trybou Bio BV was accounted for in the previous year using the equity method, but after exercising a call option in February 2021 Colruyt Group is now again the sole
shareholder, and this stake is therefore again fully consolidated.
The corporate name of Codevco II NV was changed to Agripartners NV in September 2020 and of Codevco III NV to Smart Technics NV in November 2020.
