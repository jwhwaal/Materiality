How we’re delivering our Vision and Purpose
During 2020, the following key strategies were central to helping us deliver our Vision. Many of these strategies are interconnected, and so can’t be explored in one
place alone. If you want to explore a particular theme, click on the links below where you can find out more in this Report.

Engaging our Stakeholders
We understand the importance of developing strong and meaningful relationships. We know how to bring people together, how to give people a voice. But we also know
that we can’t fix everything by ourselves, and that working with others is key. To help us develop the strategies and capabilities to achieve our Vision of Co-operating for
a Fairer World, we’ve continued to build and nurture strong, reciprocal relationships with our stakeholders. These are some key examples of how we’ve worked with our
stakeholders over the past year to help us inform strategies and deliver the right products and services in the right way. This is not an exhaustive list but gives an idea
of the scale and scope of our approach. More detail on our engagement with stakeholders can be found in our Annual Report.

Our Members’ Council (page 20) holds the Board to
account. This includes reviewing and commenting on
drafts of this Report as part of its ‘holding to account’
role. Its ‘approvals’ role includes approving how values
and principles are embedded within the Co-op based
on recommendations submitted by the Executive.
•	The framework that supports the Members’ Council
   in its role of holding the Board to account is called
   the Co-op Compass, a shared way to monitor and
   measure business performance against four key
   co-operative lenses – Member Value, Member
   Voice, Co-operative Leadership and Ethical
   and Sustainable Leadership. The Council has
   formed a number of sub-committees to aid it in
   this work, including the Ethical and Sustainable
   Leadership Committee.

We’re working to build on our Fairtrade leadership,
strengthening producer communities around the
world. In 2020 we launched a new Fairtrade Producer
Engagement Strategy. Producer Engagement is the
cornerstone of our Co-op difference on Fairtrade –
the depth and authenticity of our relationship with
producers, some spanning decades.
Under normal circumstances we would visit Fairtrade
producers and have producers visit us. However,
during the pandemic, we’ve focused on maintaining
our relationships remotely and building support for
Fairtrade producers through our pioneering projects.
In 2020 we delivered 5 planned Co-op Future
of Food Sourcing Projects despite the pandemic,
investing in international development and
climate change resilience of Fairtrade communities.
This has resulted in:                                         In November, Jo Whitfield, Chief Executive, Food, issued letters to 24 key Fairtrade producers in our supply

Growing Co-op contribution
to Fairtrade producers –
increasing our range
In 2020 we grew our Fairtrade range and also
launched Fairtrade Source Ingredient (FSI) Cocoa
Labelling, making Fairtrade products more visible in
store.
Coffee prices have recently been lower than they’ve
been since 2004, sparking a global coffee crisis
affecting more than 25 million smallholder coffee
farmers. Fairtrade farmers and workers are protected
from price volatility, thanks to the Fairtrade Minimum
Price, yet they are reliant on customers buying their
coffee on Fairtrade terms.
In response, we’ve expanded and revamped our
Fairtrade coffee range, introduced new origins and
a series of Limited Editions, as well as expanding our
Fairtrade tea range. We’ve also launched Ever Ground,
Co-op’s new Coffee to Go brand, bringing Fairtrade
coffee, tea and hot chocolate in trial participating
stores. And our Honest Value range, which we
launched in 2020, is the only own-label value brand in
the UK that includes Fairtrade products.

The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the way we carry out on-the-ground due diligence. In response to this, we have altered some of our due diligence processes
by introducing Sedex Virtual Assessments (SVA), worker surveys and direct worker reporting to gain insights into working conditions and worker feedback.
As a result of the impacts of carrying out on-site audits, we have accepted a 6-month extension for audits to take place. Where audits have been delayed, this has
increased the number of outstanding non-conformances whilst we await on-site audits or SVAs to take place and verify improvements made. We are continuing
to work closely with suppliers to ensure improvements are made and appropriate due diligence takes place.

 	Assurance and sampling of our refrigerant leak data for 2020 identified minor discrepancies in records provided by one of our responsible contractors. This will be reviewed in 2021 but is not expected to be significant enough to materially impact our
   reported total GHG emissions.

 	Until 2017, we reported our electricity as being 99% renewable, to account for the small number of new properties we open and the minority of sites for which we cannot source a renewable supply.
   We changed to report this as 100% renewable from 2017 onwards, purchasing excess renewable energy guarantee of origin certificates (REGOs) in alignment with the GHG Protocol (and other initiatives such as RE100).

 	Until 2017, we reported our electricity as being 99% renewable, to account for the small number of new properties we open and the minority of sites for which we cannot source a renewable supply.
   We changed to report this as 100% renewable from 2017 onwards, purchasing excess renewable energy guarantee of origin certificates (REGOs) in alignment with the GHG Protocol (and other initiatives such as RE100).

 	For 2017 onwards, we have put in place new systems to allow us to accurately track food waste based on the weight of products from all of our stores scanned out as being binned. This is a ‘product only’ weight and doesn’t include packaging.
   For our 2015 baseline we have used ‘whole bin’ food waste data from our waste contractor, with a proportion removed for packaging based on our new accurate product weights.
   Data from 2019 has been restated to correct an accounting error which included waste collected on behalf of others, therefore slightly over-reporting our total waste.                                                                                  100

    The Co-operative Group Ltd (“the Co-op”) commissioned DNV GL Business Assurance Services UK Limited (“DNV”, “we”, or “us”) to undertake independent assurance of its Sustainability Report 2020 (the “Report”) for the
    year ended 31st December 2020.
                                   Our Opinion:
                                   • On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Report does not properly describe the Co-op’s adherence to the Principles of
                                       stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, completeness, materiality and quality.
                                   • In terms of reliability of the performance data, nothing came to our attention to suggest that these data have not been properly collated from information reported
                                       at operational level, nor that the assumptions used were inappropriate.
    Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a separate report to the Co-op’s Management. Selected observations are provided below. These observations do not affect our conclusion set out above.
    Sustainability context                                                                                            Stakeholder inclusiveness
    The presentation of the organisation’s performance in the wider context of sustainability.                        The participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to
                                                                                                                      sustainability.
    The Co-op‘s responsible business strategies continued to evolve, including the re-focusing of the community
    strategy, and the launch of the commitments to reduce racial inequality. The newly established Vision             The Co-op’s membership structure continues to provide a unique foundation for stakeholder engagement. The

    embedding its Vision as well as providing oversight of the commitments and targets made in the different          motions from members and the Council relating to responsible business activity and the equality and inclusion
    strategies, across all business areas.                                                                            think tank. Going forward, the Vision Activation Steering Group should consider the outcomes of relevant

    The commitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2040 is a good example of how the Co-op demonstrates the
    sustainability context of its climate change programme.                                                           Completeness

    to ensure emerging issues continue to be monitored.                                                               The accuracy and comparability of information presented in the Report, as well as the quality of underlying

    The Report includes a significant number of targets for 2020 and beyond which include commitments as well as
    specific outcomes, which have been mapped against the Sustainable Development Goals this year. We carry           Overall, for the data in scope and based on the work we performed, we had confidence in the processes and

    Within the scope of our work, we found that the management approach for priority issues was well embedded
    within the business, and the Report format provided an accessible summary of this.
