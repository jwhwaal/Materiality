Foreword
Coop posts solid results
                           The coronavirus pandemic had a significant impact on the 2020 financial year
                           for Coop and challenged the company in all areas. During this difficult period,
                           our main priority was to protect our employees and customers, to safeguard the
                           security of supply of foods and essential goods for the population and to ensure
                           the stability of the entire Coop Group.
                           Despite the numerous challenges such as the closure of all non-food and retail
                           catering formats as well as the slump in demand for cash & carry and wholesale
                           supplies at the Transgourmet Group, Coop achieved a stable profit of CHF 539
                           million on sales of CHF 30.2 billion. This showed once again that our diversification
                           strategy with the two sectors Retail and Wholesale/Production has paid off.
                           In Retail, net sales grew by CHF 1.1 billion to CHF 19.1 billion, an increase of 6.3%.
                           Net sales for Coop Supermarkets of CHF 12.0 billion exceeded the previous year’s
                           figure by 14.3%. They thus generated strong growth and gained substantial mar-
                           ket share. This success is primarily due to our impressive range of sustainable
                           products and our dense sales outlet network with 944 stores throughout Switzer-
                           land. We are therefore very close to our customers. The results also show that our
                           investment in implementing the new, attractive store concept is continuing to
                           pay off. Our appealing, complete range of low-price products also impressed our
                           customers. In 2020 we reduced the prices of a further 1 000 articles. Other reasons
                           for the positive result were the temporary elimination of cross-border shopping
                           and increased demand for foodstuffs owing to restaurants being closed.

Foreword                                                                                                     7
Coop Group Annual Report 2020
                         For the specialist formats the lockdown meant that at times over 1 000 non-food
                         outlets had to close and over 13 000 employees were suddenly unable to carry
                         out their usual work. It is worth noting that the specialist formats recovered
                         quickly after the lockdown and were largely able to offset any losses in sales.
                         They achieved net sales of CHF 7.2 billion. The consumer electronics business
                         lifted sales by CHF 41 million to CHF 2.1 billion, thus consolidating its leadership
                         position. Coop Building & Hobby, Livique/Lumimart and Betty Bossi performed
                         especially well, each generating sales growth of over 10%.
                         Online retail sales were also on a growth trajectory in 2020, and not only during
                         the lockdown. One such highlight is the recently restructured omni channel platform
                         coop.ch, which increased sales by 45.5% to CHF 232 million and gained market
                         share. Online sales in the whole Coop Group amounted to CHF 2.6 billion.
                         Net sales of the Wholesale/Production business area totalled CHF 12.6 billion,
                         which equates to an index of 92.1% after adjusting for exchange rates.
                         Wholesale – the Transgourmet Group – was particularly hard hit by the pandemic.
                         The closure of hotels, restaurants and staff restaurants and the cancellation of
                         events meant that some national subsidiaries, especially in cash & carry and
                         wholesale supplies, had to contend with significant slumps in sales. On the other
                         hand, cash & carry proved to be a stable basis. Transgourmet’s strategy of com-
                         bining cash & carry and wholesale supplies thus stood its ground even during the
                         coronavirus crisis. The Transgourmet Group generated net sales of CHF 8.1 billion.
                         The manufacturing companies also made an extraordinary effort during the lock-
                         down: a number of companies greatly expanded their production capacities and
                         worked many extra shifts. They thus contributed to ensuring that food supplies
                         in Switzerland were guaranteed at all times. Net sales of the manufacturing com-
                         panies grew by CHF 44 million in local currency, totalling CHF 4.9 billion.
                         The whole Coop Group generated record sales of CHF 5.4 billion with sustainable
                         products in 2020, an increase of around CHF 738 million. Coop therefore retains
                         its number one position in the field of sustainability in Switzerland. Sales of
                         organic products again saw strong growth of CHF 210 million and amounted to
                         over CHF 2 billion.
                         We were especially pleased with the trust and loyalty of our customers and the
                         huge commitment of our employees. Our workforce of 90 825 – more than 1 300
                         more than in the previous year – demonstrated great solidarity throughout the
                         company even in hectic times. At this point we wish to express our sincere thanks.
                         Looking back, we can say that Coop mastered the difficult coronavirus year well
                         and, thanks to a strong cash flow and solid equity base, is well placed for continued
                         successful development.

Strategy and operating
environment
With innovative ranges, the expansion of modern store
concepts and new formats, Coop is making a state-
ment which strengthens its position on the Swiss re-
tail market. Coop is driving forward digitalization in
all areas, is automating processes and is adapting its
supply chain to new demands. In wholesale, Coop is
working with Transgourmet to broaden its expertise
and is expanding in its existing markets. Coop is com-
mitted to sustainability and verticalization in the pro-
duction of strategically important goods and benefits
from an efficient organization.
Profile of the Coop Group
Active in retail as well as wholesale and production
The Coop Group operates in the retail as well as wholesale and production sectors. In the retail sector,
Coop operates supermarkets and various specialist formats in Switzerland.
The Coop Group is the market leader in many of these formats. In wholesale, the Coop Group operates
in Germany, Poland, Romania, Russia, France, Austria and Switzerland through Transgourmet. The
Transgourmet Group is Europe’s second-largest cash & carry and food service company. In the produc-
tion sector, the internationally active Bell Food Group is the biggest company in the Coop Group. In ad-
dition to the Bell Food Group, the Coop Group also operates other manufacturing companies in Switzer-
land.
The Coop Group is a cooperative
The Coop Group has a history that goes back over 150 years and it has always been structured along
cooperative lines. At the organizational level, it is divided into six regions and has over 2.5 million coop-
erative members. For the Coop Group, the focus is on the customers - the members of the cooperative.
It gears all its efforts to their needs. As a cooperative, the Coop Group does not strive to maximize prof-
its; because of this, it plans sustainably for the long term.
Strategies and objectives
Aligned to the Corporate Profile
A shared vision, a shared corporate profile and company-specific mission statements shape the Coop
Group’s day-to-day work and corporate culture. Over 90 000 employees share the same Group vision:
“Together to the top”. The corporate profile is also the same for all sales formats and companies in the
Coop Group. It expresses how we perceive our work: close, diverse, distinctive, innovative and partner-
ship-oriented. The mission statements are set out for each company and each format individually and
reflect its positioning in the sector and strategic focus. With their respective mission statements, the
companies and formats make their contribution to the Group-wide vision and corporate profile.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Growth and internationalization
In terms of growth and internationalization, the Coop Group pursues two strategic thrusts.
In retail, efforts are focused on the targeted optimization of the network of sales outlets. This involves
making adjustments to the ranges and launching new formats which pick up specific trends. Moreover,
the Coop companies engage with digitalization to introduce new online shops and services, further ex-
pand the omnichannel offering and make processes more efficient. In this way, the Coop Group is
strengthening its position on the domestic market. In wholesale, it is opening up new markets in Europe,
thereby expanding the market position of the Transgourmet units. This can be secured both through
organic growth and through acquisitions.
Verticalization
For goods of particular strategic importance, Coop is committed to verticalization, i.e. integrating man-
ufacturing companies into its business activities. Whether meat from the Bell Food Group, water from
Pearlwater, cereals from Swissmill or chocolate from Chocolats Halba/Sunray, integrating the manufac-
turing companies enables Coop to respond swiftly to new trends and exploit the synergies between the
Retail and Wholesale/Production business areas. The business areas generally work closely together
and exploit synergies in purchasing and logistics. Furthermore, the manufacturing companies produce
products for retail and wholesale. The objective is to exhaust the available synergy potential, set the
range apart with distinctive products, and attain even greater efficiency, which will translate into lower
consumer prices.
Digitalization
Coop is pursuing two main strategic thrusts where digitalization is concerned. The primary purpose of
digitalization must be to even better meet customers’ individual needs and simplify the shopping pro-
cess. At the same time, it should make behind-the-scenes processes even more efficient and economi-
cal.
Coop has devised a digitalization concept specifically for this, which is systematically geared towards
customer service and is broken down into seven pillars. Topics such as “E-Business & CRM”, “Category
Management & Purchasing”, “Communication”, “Goods flow management” and “Logistics” as well as
“E-back office” and “IT Infrastructure” are the priorities.
One cornerstone is the omnichannel approach, combining online and in-store trading. The Coop com-
panies are among the leading Swiss companies in online trading. Besides the online shop coop.ch with
its supermarket range, virtually all non-food specialist formats have their own online store. Goods or-
dered online can either be delivered to the customer’s home or collected in person at the POS of the
specialist format in question or at one of more than 1 100 pick-up stations (click & collect). Drawing on
its wide network of POS, the Coop Group is systematically increasing the number of pick-up stations in
Switzerland. In total, the Coop Group operates 40 online shops, 23 of those in retail and 17 in the
Wholesale/Production business area.
As well as the omnichannel approach, Coop is also committed to the Microspot.ch e-business platform,
which is the Coop Group’s non-food platform. This Swiss online shopping portal brings together nation-
al and international wholesalers as distributors, and sells an extensive, diverse range of non-food prod-
ucts. Microspot.ch also has products from the Coop Group’s non-food formats, including Coop Building
& Hobby, Import Parfumerie and Christ Watches & Jewellery.
Digitalization provides lots of opportunities to open up new markets. Coop is also driving the develop-
ment of innovations, as a main partner of Digital Switzerland and with Kickstart Accelerator – the digital
innovation hub for start-ups.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Purchasing strategy
The aim of Coop’s purchasing strategy is to secure access to raw material sources and safeguard the
high quality of those sources. In Switzerland, Coop is committed to long-term partnerships with Swiss
agriculture. Purchasing regional and local products, as well as organic products, is an important aspect
of this. Sustainability is a key element of purchasing, both at home and abroad. Working with producers
in emerging and developing countries in particular, Coop is implementing a multitude of projects which
involve high social responsibility and environmental standards. The projects also stabilize income and
production in those countries. The Coop Group handles the purchasing of food and non-food products
in Asia via its subsidiary Eurogroup Far East Ltd. The branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Delhi and, since
spring 2020, in Ho Chi Minh City enable the Coop Group to safeguard and enforce all the quality speci-
fications on the local market, and to support business partners in the Far East in implementing environ-
mental and social standards. Coop subsidiary Alifresca is responsible for purchasing fruit and vegeta-
bles in Spain and Italy. As well as providing customers with quality assurance, Alifresca also delivers the
goods to all of the Coop Group’s distribution points throughout Europe, ensuring the right quantities
reach each market. Alifresca’s Food division has expanded the purchase and delivery of cheese from
Italy and integrated more product lines, such as panettone. Agecore, the internationally renowned pur-
chasing alliance in Europe formed to promote the development of cross-border activities in the retail
sector, is also seeking to create additional synergies in purchasing. Both nationally and internationally,
Coop is committed to long-term partnerships with its suppliers, with whom Coop is optimizing the sup-
ply chain and exploiting synergies.
Quality management
For 115 years, Coop has been operating laboratories in order to satisfy stringent product quality
requirements. Taking a risk-oriented approach, the laboratories test products at every stage of the
product chain for compliance with the statutory quality and safety requirements, as well as industry
standards and the relevant norms. Business partners of Coop and Coop’s employees also play a crucial
role in quality assurance. Coop selects reliable business partners who satisfy the quality requirements
and whose manufacturing processes are certified to international standards. There are inspection con-
cepts in place for own-label brands and officially recognized labels which serve to guarantee compli-
ance with the relevant requirements. As well as its own inspection activities carried out by quality as-
surance experts, Coop also works with independent inspection agencies.
Goal-setting process
To ensure that long-term strategies give rise to effective measures each year, the Coop Group has, since
2001, had a uniform, top-down goal-setting process in place. Every year, it defines key objectives that
apply to the Group as a whole. Based on these goals, concrete measures are developed right down to
the operational levels. With a view to the continuous further development of its sustainability commit-
ment, the Coop Group has set multi-year targets for all divisions covering the three pillars of its sustain-
ability concept.
Economic and political environment
Retail in the shadow of the corona pandemic
Swiss retail was dominated by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The Federal Council’s decision to
close all non-food stores from 17 March 2020 to 10 May 2020 and to restrict the range to essential
goods caused sales to plummet. After recovering in the ensuing months, in the autumn and winter retail
took another hit with the arrival of the second coronavirus wave and renewed closures of non-food sales
outlets as well as curbs on the catering segment in some cantons. This took a severe toll on restaurants
and hotels and, to some extent, sales of the non-food formats declined. The food stores were able to
stay open throughout the year and, overall, recorded pleasing growth in sales. The food sector benefited
from the selective travel restrictions, which curbed shopping tourism, and from widespread homework-
ing, which reduced the amount of food that people consumed outside the home.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Commitment to the circular economy
In the year under review, the circular economy became even more relevant. A number of political initia-
tives introduced measures to promote the conservation of resources, the lifespan of products, and the
collection and recycling of packaging. Coop takes its responsibility to close loops seriously, and is mak-
ing particularly concerted efforts in
the area of packaging. Among other things, Coop has established a coffee capsule collection service (for
aluminium capsules) and begun testing new, environmentally-friendly packaging solutions. It is impor-
tant to involve and collaborate with the entire value chain in these endeavours, from production and
sales to collection and recycling, and to take a coordinated, international approach. Coop is committed
to Swiss Recycling’s circular economy platform, which brings together the relevant stakeholders to take
concerted action.
Agricultural policy 2022+
2020 saw intense parliamentary debate about the future political parameters for agriculture. As well as
the dispatch on agricultural reform from 2022 onwards, reducing the use of pesticides was another key
issue on the political agenda. This is particularly pertinent in light of the upcoming referenda in 2021 on
two initiatives seeking to reduce or prohibit outright the use of synthetic pesticides. Coop believes that
action needs to be taken on pesticides. Therefore, among other things it has backed the enshrinement
of a binding reduction schedule for pesticides in the Agriculture Act. Furthermore, as part of a broad
alliance of producers, processors, and environmental organizations, Coop has pushed for a swift debate
on the agricultural reform bill, which is intended to take account of consumers’ changing expectations
of the farming and food industries.

Strong inner drive for sustainability                                                                 14
Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Strong inner drive
for sustainability
Sustainability is part of Coop’s corporate DNA and
imbues all its relevant strategies. The focus is on sus-
tainable products, environment and climate protec-
tion as well as commitment to employees and society.
Coop’s approach to sustainability management is key
to a sustainably successful future.
Strong awareness of sustainability
After 30 years of strong commitment to sustainability, it has become a major part of Coop’s corporate
DNA. The Coop Group has enshrined sustainability in its Articles of Association, its Corporate Profile
and its missions and integrated it into all relevant strategies and processes. To give one example, sus-
tainability targets are systematically incorporated in the comprehensive target-setting process, the
training of employees and in operating processes and procedures.
Through its comprehensive approach to sustainability, the Coop Group seeks to set itself apart by de-
livering added value in the various markets, securing access to resources and making sustainability a
shared value throughout the Coop Group. By doing this, Coop also ensures that the growing demands
made by society and politicians are implemented efficiently and credibly throughout its business activ-
ities, thus making a contribution to the wider public interest.
Coop’s main reporting channels for its numerous sustainability-related measures are the Coop Member
Press, the new ‘Coopzeitung Weekend’ member press, the Internet platform actions-not-words.ch and
the integrated Annual Report of the Coop Group. A Sustainability Progress Report is published annually.
Sharing specific information, the report provides a detailed insight into Coop’s commitment to sustain-
ability and the percentage of attainment of its multi-year sustainability targets.
Holistic and highly relevant
Coop’s sustainability efforts are concentrated on areas in which Coop can achieve significant leverage.
These areas are determined by internal analyses and have high social, environmental or economic rele-
vance. When setting priorities, Coop draws on many different tools such as range screening, life assess-
ment cycles, risk monitors and stakeholder dialogue. Societal expectations and political demands are
also major factors when choosing priorities.
The key areas are reflected in Coop’s Sustainability strategy concept, which describes how the issue of
sustainability is managed at Coop and how sustainability is holistically integrated within the existing
management system. The strategy concept is based on three pillars (Sustainable Products, Environ-
ment and Climate Protection, and Employees and Social Commitment), which in turn build on the foun-
dation, the strategic basis. The three pillars represent the starting points that the companies of the
Coop Group integrate into their business activities. All these elements come together to enable us to
successfully implement the sustainability targets, yielding success for the company and benefiting the
common good.

The strategic basis
Coop is a cooperative and promotes the economic and social interests of its members and its consum-
ers. Economic, environmental and ethical principles secure the cooperative’s competitiveness and con-
tinued existence. Sustainability is also pivotal to our Vision 2025+, in which Coop sets itself apart from
its competitors through sustainable products and its commitment to sustainability projects. The guid-
ing principles of sustainability also contribute to this distinctiveness: they determine which principles
apply to the implementation of overarching objectives and are used for internal communication through-
out the Coop Group.
Pillar 1: Sustainable products
Coop is committed to observing ambitious minimum requirements along the whole value chain, in all
product ranges. In addition, Coop is involved in pioneering sourcing projects and long-term partner-
ships to promote organic farming, fair trade, animal welfare and biodiversity. The own-label sustainabil-
ity brands and quality seals play an important role here, being the medium through which Coop sets
itself apart with the most stringent standards in Swiss retail. Coop promotes sustainable consumption,
with conscious range selection, targeted customer information and a variety of advertising activities.
Pillar 2: Environment and climate protection
The efficient use of resources and energy also contributes to cutting costs. Coop’s efforts focus on re-
ducing energy consumption and making increased use of renewable energy, as well as the consistent
implementation of the “CO2-neutral by 2023” vision, which was adopted back in 2008. Coop has de-
fined a reduction schedule, and the implementation is still on track thanks to its own defined measures
and targets. Other important topics are packaging optimization, waste avoidance and recycling, logis-
tics and goods transport, and water management, hydrogen technology and sustainable construction.
Coop is making special efforts to optimize packaging, an area in which it is committed to the responsible
use of plastics.
Pillar 3: Employees and social commitment
Pillar 3 covers Coop’s commitment to employees and social projects with relevance to society. As an
employer, Coop provides training for apprentices, a standardized, progressive collective employment
agreement for the whole of Switzerland, and a generous pension scheme. By supporting the organiza-
tions “Schweizer Tafel” (Swiss Table) and “Tischlein deck dich” (Table Be Set), Coop makes a substantial
contribution to the responsible use of foodstuffs. Another key aspect is our commitment to Coop Aid for
Mountain Regions and our collaboration with strategic partners such as the Swiss Red Cross (SRC).

Strong inner drive for sustainability                                                                     16

Coop Sustainability Fund
Coop finances projects from all three pillars through the Coop Sustainability Fund. Customers experi-
ence the result of these projects, not just in Coop’s range but when doing their daily shopping. Promo-
tions and events for employees and the public are a direct expression of the Fund’s innovative solutions
to key social and environmental issues. Through pioneering work in the area of sustainability, Coop
raises public awareness of sustainable consumption. The Coop Sustainability Fund currently has access
to funds of at least 16.5 million francs a year to implement such projects.

www.actions-not-words.ch/fund.
Strategic anchoring in wholesale and production
All companies of the Transgourmet Group as well as the main Coop manufacturing companies have their
own sustainability strategies. The strategies are geared towards Coop’s Sustainability strategy concept
and each take account of the specific concerns as well as the realities of the relevant markets.
Overarching topics in the area of sustainability
The companies of the Coop Group continued their impressive track record on sustainability in the year
under review. Below, we discuss selected sustainability projects. News on sustainable projects from the
individual business areas is assigned to the respective chapters.
New “Inner Drive” sustainability campaign
In October, Coop launched the new “Inner Drive” campaign, which expresses Coop’s dynamic approach
to sustainability and places the focus on Coop’s 390-plus sustainable actions which lie at the heart of
sustainability communication. The campaign is being publicized throughout Switzerland, via the digital
and print channels used for marketing and corporate communication. Coop’s “Actions, not words” sus-
tainability initiative, with the eponymous platform www.actions-not-words.ch, also relays our diverse
commitment to sustainability along with all the background on the subject of sustainability.
Coop redoubles efforts to reduce plastic in packaging
Coop has been committed to reducing plastic since 2012 and, step by step, is implementing alterna-
tives. In 2020, Coop achieved two more key milestones. Each year, around 182 tonnes of plastic are
saved by no longer providing the plastic disposable cutlery that was routinely included with take-away
salads, muesli and bowls, and no longer giving out free plastic disposable cutlery at the checkouts.
Having abandoned plastic disposable cutlery, we have been able to optimize the packaging of take-away
salads and muesli, enabling Coop to save a further 14 tonnes of plastic. Greater use of recycled materi-
als is another major milestone. All PET bottles for Swiss Alpina mineral water (1 L, 1.5 L, 50 cl) are made
entirely from recycled Swiss PET bottles. This totals 24.5 million bottles each year, and means that
Coop is closing the bottle loop in Switzerland and saving around 450 tonnes of plastic. For more infor-
mation about reducing plastic at Coop, visit: www.actions-not-words.ch/packaging.
Best Swiss retailer in the WWF Palm Oil Scorecard
Coop emerged as the best Swiss retailer in the WWF’s Palm Oil Scorecard. Its Vision for Palm Oil, which
it adopted in 2018, marks a huge stride forward and Coop now exclusively uses Bio Suisse-certified
palm oil from rigorously sustainable production in its own-label foods. Where it makes sense to do so,
palm oil is replaced with other oils and fats, with preference given to products from Switzerland such as
rapeseed or sunflower oil. If other tropical oils or fats such as coconut oil are used, they must come from
Fairtrade, Bio-Suisse or Rainforest Alliance-certified production. At present Coop uses palm oil in
around 1 000 own-label foods. In principle, Coop’s Vision for Palm Oil is to be implemented by the end
of 2021. This is unique in global retail and further underscores Coop’s pioneering status in sustainabil-
ity. Transgourmet is also taking responsibility and, in future, will no longer use palm oil in selected
products.

Strong inner drive for sustainability                                                                  17

Innovative hydrogen-powered trucks and transporting goods by rail
Sustainability in logistics is, and will remain important to Coop. In 2020, Coop added the first seven
mass-produced hydrogen-powered trucks to its fleet. Coop.ch also uses environmentally-friendly trucks
as its delivery vehicles. Furthermore, over 45% of Coop’s fleet of trucks are fuelled by biodiesel from
organic waste, such as used cooking oil, from Switzerland. With its subsidiary Railcare, Coop is success-
fully rolling out the concept of unaccompanied combined transport (UCT) which, since 2011, has ena-
bled more and more goods to be transported by rail. This involves transporting the goods to the nearest
rail hub in swap bodies and transferring them to trains. The freight containers are transported from the
destination rail hub to the points of sale by road. There was another sharp increase in rail freight in
2020. Overall, over five times more goods were carried by Railcare than in 2010, saving 66 600 tonnes
of CO2.
Transgourmet Österreich becomes CO2-neutral
Guided by the motto “Avoid, Minimize, Offset”, Transgourmet Österreich rounded off its wide-ranging
sustainability drive and offset currently unavoidable CO2 emissions of 12 629 tonnes of CO2 in 2020
through a climate protection project. Transgourmet Österreich selected the following project for this
purpose: the gold standard Godawari Power climate project project, which supplies biomass from rice
husks for electricity generation, as a substitute for fossil fuels..

Retail Business Area
With Coop.ch, Coop is revolutionizing its digital pres-
ence and adding even more sustainable and inexpen-
sive products to its already extensive range. Compre-
hensive measures are needed in all areas to tackle the
Covid pandemic, which has seen demand surge at on-
line shops.
Coop’s retail business was greatly impacted by the Covid pandemic during the year under review. On 16
March, the Federal Council ordered all non-food formats and restaurants to close, and restricted ranges
in supermarkets. Over 1 000 sales outlets had to close and more than 13 000 employees suddenly
found themselves unable to perform their usual activities. At the same time, demand in supermarkets
and at the online formats surged, placing severe demands on employees at the sales outlets, as well as
processes in the background. Employees in the supermarkets and in other areas showed tremendous
dedication in rising to this challenge. During lockdown, they received support from their colleagues in
the temporarily closed trading formats, the catering and restaurant business, and wholesale. This show
of solidarity will long be remembered. At this difficult time, it was imperative both to protect employees
and to safeguard the security of supply of foods and essential goods.
In 2020, the Coop Group generated net sales of 19.1 billion francs in Retail, and its extensive network of
supermarket sales outlets and their proximity to customers proved a tremendous asset. To some ex-
tent, the non-food formats were able to offset sales lost during lockdown with record sales at their own
online shops.
Sales formats and range
In the Retail business area, the Coop Group operates supermarkets as well as numerous specialist for-
mats for every customer need. At the end of 2020, it had 2 349 sales outlets throughout Switzerland,
which is X more than the previous year. Coop also boasts a wide range of online shops and systemati-
cally combines online and offline trade (omnichannel). Almost all of Coop’s specialist formats now have
their own online shops in addition to their brick-and-mortar stores. The 24 online shops in the retail
                                     segment in all achieved growth of 35.7% in 2020 compared with
                                     the previous year.

                      CHF billion
                                     Coop attaches particular strategic importance to its sustainable
                                     ranges. In 2020, Coop’s retail sales from sustainable products to-
                                     talled an encouraging 4.8 billion francs, which was up 14.5% over
                                     the previous year (for details see www.coop.ch/sd-report).
                                     Sales of organic products alone came to 1.7 billion francs, which is
                                     an increase of 14.2% year on year.
Supermarkets and food formats
The Coop supermarkets generated net sales of over 12 billion francs in 2020. Coop once again gained
many new customers and significantly increased its market shares. With 944 stores, Coop has the
densest network of sales outlets in Switzerland. In the 2020 financial year, 22 new sales outlets were
opened and 10 closed. Coop implemented the new store concept 2025+ in a total of 51 supermarkets
in 2020, bringing the total number of new-style supermarkets to 157.

Covid safety measures in sales outlets
Protecting employees and customers is Coop’s top priority. The safety concepts which Coop was quick
to develop proved effective in practice and became routine. In the entrance area, posters reminded
customers of the requirement to wear face coverings. Disinfectants and disposable gloves were also
available at the entrance. Daily cleaning of various surfaces, such as shopping trolleys, was stepped up.
In the checkout area, plexiglass screens, floor markings and posters kept everyone safe. In addition,
Coop used in-store radio to remind customers to maintain social distancing and wear a face mask. Em-
ployees protected themselves and everyone else by wearing their face coverings correctly.
Customers overwhelmingly grateful to sales staff
Buoyed up by words of encouragement and an outpouring of gratitude from customers, staff at the
sales outlets went above and beyond during the Covid pandemic. Employees were very touched by the
solidarity shown by customers, who wrote lots of letters and created many collages and drawings.
Coop.ch wins Digital Champion Award 2020
To further improve the shopping experience, Coop launched omnichannel platform Coop.ch. The new
website merges the existing websites of Coop@home, Coop.ch and Mondovino. At the heart of Coop.ch
is the holistic shopping experience, from planning to purchase. Now, for instance, customers can write
a shopping list and retrieve it on the new Coop app in store. From now on, the availability of all products
and promotions will be shown in any branch of choice in real time. Customers can link the new platform
to their Supercard account and take advantage of all the benefits of the extensive customer programme.
The Click & Collect service also enables customers to conveniently order the products they want from
home and collect them from 350 sales outlets. The website impressed the jury in the Digital Commerce
Award, which named Coop.ch Digital Commerce Champion and, therefore, the best online shop in 2020.
Product range diversity
As well as stocking the biggest selection of national and international branded products, Coop also
stocks numerous own-label brands for every customer need in all its sales formats. In food retailing
alone, with over 40 000 products in the food and non-food segment it offers the greatest product range
diversity in Switzerland. As well as own-label sustainability brands and quality labels, Coop also stocks
other own-label brands that cover diverse customer needs and offer optimum value for money.
Flow of goods and maintaining optimum stock levels during the COVID-19 crisis
The Covid crisis triggered an unprecedented run on the food sales formats. Every day, the crisis team
set up to manage the flow of goods had to anticipate the constantly changing situation with regard to
purchasing, national and international logistics capacities, and sales-based ordering for the branches.
Sometimes, radical and unconventional measures had to be taken at very short notice. To cope with the
huge additional volumes of leader items, Coop created brand-new logistics platforms and put a tempo-
rary freeze on part of the range at the Wangen distribution centre. Although it wasn’t always possible to
completely avoid gaps in the range, Coop was generally able to assure deliveries of a wide array of items
to the sales outlets at all times. Coop continuously fulfilled its federal mandate of supplying the popu-
lation with food and essential goods.
Expansion of vegan and vegetarian range
Coop is continually expanding its range of vegetarian and vegan products. There are now more than
1 200 products certified with the SwissVeg V-Label on Coop’s shelves. This includes around 1 000 ve-
gan products. The popular own-label brand Karma, which now comprises more than 300 products, is a
key component of the varied range of vegetarian items. In addition to the naturally vegetarian Karma
products, Coop also stocks a wide range of vegetarian and vegan cheese, milk, meat and fish alterna-
tives. At the start of 2020, Coop became the first retailer to launch the popular pea-based chicken al-
ternatives of Zurich’s ETH start-up “planted”. Other all-plant highlights in the range include The Green
Mountain Burger, tuna fish substitute Vuna, a tartar, and raclette and meatloaf for baking at home.
Switzerland’s best plant-based burger
The Green Mountain Burger was inspired by the natural beauty of the Swiss mountains. It was developed
and produced by Bell subsidiary Hilcona, in Landquart, Graubünden. The burger, which was launched in

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
April 2020, quickly made it to the top 5 of all plant-based alternatives in Coop’s range. The Green Moun-
tain Burger is made from yellow split peas and is convincingly similar to an original meat burger in ap-
pearance, consistency, and taste. It is therefore no surprise that, in October 2020, The Green Mountain
Burger was named by the Kassensturz consumer protection TV programme as Switzerland’s best plant-
based burger.
Successful organic range and closer cooperation with Bio Suisse
Coop achieved further exceptional growth with its organic products in 2020. Sales of the Naturaplan
organic own-label brand grew by 15.8% to 1.5 billion francs. In total, the Coop Group generated sales of
2 billion francs from organic products; in retail sales, Naturaplan products already account for over
13%. This makes Coop the undisputed market leader in Switzerland. The Covid crisis highlighted a
growing desire among customers for the most natural and healthy foods possible. Due to the closure of
restaurants, customers were preparing more of their meals at home, and seeking out natural and healthy
foods with which to cook. Coop launched more than 150 new Naturaplan products in 2020, such as
yoghurts and iced teas with no added sugar, wood-fired Butterzopf braided loaves, and new Demeter
products such as olive oil, breads, and dried tomatoes. Coop has set itself the goal of achieving above-av-
erage growth and attaining organic sales of CHF 2.5 billion by 2025. Since the launch of own-label or-
ganic brand Naturaplan in 1993, Coop has adhered fully to the bud label awarded by Bio Suisse, whose
guidelines are among the most stringent in the world. The enduring, successful collaboration between
Coop and the Bio Suisse organization was renewed and consolidated in 2020, with the shared goal of
greatly advancing the organic market in Switzerland over the next few years.
Extending cooperation with IP-Suisse
At the end of February 2020, Coop informed Naturafarm pork producers that responsibility for main-
taining the guidelines for this own-label animal welfare brand was being handed over to the farming
organization IP-Suisse. The new guidelines set more stringent requirements for biodiversity and sus-
tainability. The products will continue to be sold under the Naturafarm own-label brand. Coop used this
partnership as an opportunity to step up its sustainability in other areas, and is switching a variety of
Swiss Qualité & Prix products, such as milk, cream, flour, bread and sugar, from conventional to inte-
grated production. These products bear the ladybird symbol, which is the IP-Suisse quality label that is
synonymous with added value that includes: products that are entirely of Swiss origin, efforts to pro-
mote diversity, avoidance of pesticides whenever possible, and the careful use of resources.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Prix Garantie range expanded
Coop increased the Prix Garantie range to around 1 000 items during the year under review. The new
products are from all areas of the range: from apple spritzer and hummus to pesto and Zopf flour (a
special flour used e.g. for plaited loaves). New items such as fajitas and avocados provide inspiration for
family meals, and products such as falafel burgers and soya milks are suitable for vegetarian and vegan
diets. Prix Garantie is therefore far more than just a basic range. All products must live up to the range
promise: Prix Garantie is a range of good quality, low-price products. By expanding this range, Coop is
taking even greater account of the needs of all customer groups, in particular families, and offering an
increasingly diverse range of products at low prices. The packaging relaunch for existing Prix Garantie
products is also under way, with new packaging that boasts an attractive culinary design with a premi-
um look.
Disposable face masks and fabric masks at Coop
Even in the early days of 2020, the Covid pandemic triggered increased demand for face masks. Procur-
ing and transporting disposable face masks proved challenging. Coop’s priority was to maintain high
quality and social standards in production. Thanks to reliable partners and agile logistics, Coop was
able to guarantee constant product availability. Coop was the first retailer to stock fabric masks and,
since August, customers have been able to buy EMPA-tested and certified fabric masks. Customers
benefit from an attractive and varied range that represents very good value for money.
On track for success with flavoured mineral water
With growth of more than 50% nationwide, flavoured waters are the fastest-growing product group in
the beverages category. They account for a market share of 17% of the mineral water market, and that
figure is rising fast. The Coop Naturaplan own-label brands, which include lemon, mint, and cucumber
flavours, are the leading flavoured sparkling waters in Switzerland. To build on this success, in 2020
Coop launched a Swiss Alpina Plus line alongside Naturaplan which, with raspberry and elderflower
flavours, offers an intense taste experience. The mineral waters produced by Coop’s own Pearlwater
manufacturing facility in Termen (Valais) now account for more than 6% of total retail sales, and this
percentage is also rising.
Coop is committed to lower consumer prices
In 2020 Coop remained committed to low consumer prices. Coop has reduced the prices of over 1 000
products in several price-cutting rounds. These include branded articles and own-label brands, such as
in the Prix Garantie range plus fruit and vegetables. In the year under review, Coop invested 145 million
francs in lower sales prices. Coop announced all of the price adjustments in the Coop Member Press.

Non-Food specialist formats
During the lockdown, from 16 March to 27 April, all non-food specialist formats had to close. Over 1 000
sales outlets and more than 13 000 employees were affected. Immediately after the closure of the sales
outlets, Coop set up an internal job centre to arrange work for the staff from the non-food formats in the
sales outlets, logistics and manufacturing. This unparalleled solidarity enabled us to cope with the chal-
lenges of the supermarkets that remained open, as well as logistics and manufacturing. In November
and December, the cantons of Geneva (from 2 to 23 November), Solothurn and Aargau (from 27 Decem-
ber) again closed sales outlets with non-food products. Thanks to the already well-established om-
nichannel strategy, the loss of sales in physical stores suffered by the individual formats was, to some
extent, cushioned by the sharp rise in sales of the respective online platforms. Thus, despite the clo-
sures, the non-food formats generated net sales of over 7.2 billion francs and succeeded in further in-
creasing their market shares. Coop remains a strong presence in home electronics. This segment in-
cludes the specialist formats Interdiscount, Microspot.ch, Dipl Ing. Fust and Nettoshop.ch. In 2020, the
net sales of the four formats totalled around 2.1 billion francs, which is an increase of 41 million com-
pared with the previous year. Consequently, the Coop Group was also able to strengthen its market
leadership in this area.
Non-food staff deployed in supermarkets during lockdown
The lockdown ordered by the Federal Council resulted in the closure of the non-food formats for 8 weeks
from 16 March 2020. Only the Coop Vitality pharmacies remained open, maintaining their daily commit-
ment to customers’ health. Owing to the closure of the sales outlets, thousands of staff were rede-
ployed in other areas of Coop, such as the supermarkets, logistics, and customer service. By pulling
together, throughout this challenging time Coop continued to fulfil its mandate of providing the popula-
tion with basic supplies across all formats. The health and safety of employees and customers were
paramount at all times. On 27 April 2020, Building & Hobby markets very successfully resumed trading,
followed by the remaining non-food formats on 11 May 2020.
Strong demand for online shops during Covid
Thanks to heightened demand, the online shops of the trading formats set new records in recent months,
particularly on Black Friday/Singles Day. At Building & Hobby, orders quadrupled in the space of one
week in spring. With people working from home, Interdiscount experienced increased demand for com-
puters, laptops, headsets etc. and Microspot.ch recorded an increase in all areas of the non-food range
after the stores closed. The new logistics platform in Jegenstorff enabled the increased order volume to
be accommodated. At Livique and Lumimart, online sales rose steadily from the start of lockdown, ex-
ceeding the previous year four or fivefold. Import Parfumerie recorded a record number of orders on
Easter Monday. Although the Coop Vitality pharmacies remained open, customers placed far more or-
ders than usual in the online shop. At The Body Shop, hand soaps and hand creams were the biggest
sellers, and in some instances were responsible for a fourfold increase in online orders from March on-
wards. In the first week of April, Christ Watches & Jewellery shone, with record orders leading to a daz-
zling result. Thanks to the new automated warehouses in logistics, Dipl.Ing. Fust AG fulfilled the very
high number of customer orders on a daily basis. As Switzerland’s biggest online retailer of household
appliances, Nettoshop reflected the spirit of the times during the Covid crisis, enjoying very high cus-
tomer demand.
Rebranding: Livique making good headway
Livique has performed very well in recent years, with growing sales and market shares. Its repositioning
and rebranding has established Livique as a modern, inspirational furnishing provider in the mid-price
segment. The Covid crisis has heightened the need among customers to make themselves comfortable
at home and invest in an attractive living environment. Thanks to telephone consultations and a huge
surge in online sales, Livique’s sales held steady at a high level during lockdown, and increased at a fast
pace once the stores re-opened. One year after its rebranding, the still-young Livique brand has achieved
considerable recognition, which was boosted further in 2020. The larger range of customizable furniture
and the expansion of the Etoy and Heimberg locations have kept Livique on an upward trajectory.

Coop Vitality now delivers prescription-only medicines
Medicines available only on prescription can now be easily and quickly ordered online from Coop Vitali-
ty. An option not previously available for prescription medicines, this has now been an option for the
past year thanks to the online mail-order pharmacy. To use this free service, customers must first leave
the original prescription at a Coop Vitality pharmacy, or use the prescription upload facility online. They
use their online account on the Coop Vitality website to then easily order their medicines. Repeat orders
can be placed at any time. Subject to availability, online orders received before 11.30 a.m. are delivered
by post to the customer’s home one to two working days later.
Sustainable parcel packaging machine for Interdiscount and Microspot.ch
An innovative, fully-automated packaging facility enables more efficient and sustainable parcel dis-
patch from the logistics centre in Jegenstorf. The new system, which is able to prepare a customized
shipping parcel for any product, will remove the need for fillers in future. The 24 metre-long and 16
metre-wide machine processes up to 600 parcels, packaging them all in sustainable recycled card-
board. Now, the only manual action is placing the items on the feed belt to the packaging machines; all
the other processes are automated. The finished parcels are carried on a conveyor belt via a parcel
chute to the loading area. Coop chose a regional manufacturer as its partner for this innovative system.
The packaging machine was put into operation in autumn 2020.
Fust Group biggest provider of household appliance servicing
With more than 500 service professionals employed by the Fust Group (Fust, Service7000, Schubiger
Haushalt) making visits to customers on a daily basis, Fust is the biggest Swiss provider of installation
services and servicing for household appliances. Fust primarily serves private customers, with appli-
ance deliveries and repairs throughout the home which cover the whole range of household and multi-
media appliances, as well as complete kitchen and bathroom remodels. The services provided by Ser-
vice7000 and Schubiger Haushalt are geared to the specific needs of property managers and the rental
properties they look after. Continuing Fust’s commitment to digitalization, a proprietary Internet portal,

Logistics, IT and property
Exceptional situation in logistics due to Covid
In 2020, Coop’s logistics came under severe pressure due to high demand during the pandemic. The
strain reached a peak in the spring. Unlike the usual peak times at Christmas and Easter, for which Coop
spends months preparing, suddenly and without warning record volumes had to be moved for the super-
markets and for online sales. Both employees and the logistics infrastructures worked flat out. At the
same time, we had to make sure that Logistics itself remains fit for purpose and is able to guarantee
maximum infection protection for staff. Thanks to the various, prompt measures taken by the Logistics
crisis team, the huge challenges were overcome. For example, Coop repurposed distribution centres
which, in normal circumstances are responsible for non-food ranges, in order to handle the logistics for
the sharp rise in demand for items such as toilet paper, tinned foods, dried yeast, disinfectants, etc.
Where possible, suppliers stepped up direct deliveries to the sales outlets. The employees of the closed
non-food formats and restaurants were a great help during lockdown...
Hydrogen and biogas trucks
To further improve sustainability, Coop has increased its truck fleet with more vehicles equipped with
innovative drive technologies. In 2020, Coop added 2 trucks with cutting-edge hydrogen technology and
3 gas-powered trucks to its fleet.
Novel hydrogen trucks
As a hydrogen pioneer, Coop stays ahead of the game and, in October 2020, began operating one of the
world’s first mass-produced hydrogen trucks, followed by six more models of this type. A fuel cell gen-
erates electricity from the hydrogen in the tank, which powers the truck’s electric engine quietly and
with zero emissions. Only hydrogen is used, which is produced using renewable electricity from hydro-
power. This enables Coop to save around 80 tonnes of CO2 per year, per truck and amass more experi-
ence in this field of propulsion. Since 2016, Coop has been operating the first public hydrogen filling
station in Hunzenschwil (Aargau) and, together with the association H2 Mobilität Schweiz, is pursuing
the target of creating a nationwide network of hydrogen filling stations throughout Switzerland by 2023.
Switzerland’s main transport axes should be covered by the start of 2021, and six hydrogen filling sta-
tions began operating in 2020.
Sustainable biogas trucks
In 2020, Coop purchased two semi-trailer trucks and one triaxial 26-tonne truck that are powered by
biogas. As well as far lower particulate and CO2 emissions, the reduced noise they create is an advantage
over convention diesel engines. There are many advantages to using biogas as a fuel. Even driving with
normal CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), CO2 emissions are reduced by 20% compared with a diesel vehicle.
Delivery service for vulnerable groups during Covid
To offer customers in the vulnerable age groups aged over 65 during the spring lockdown the option of
having essential foods and hygiene products delivered to their home by volunteers, in the space of just
a few days IT developed a special online ordering portal, incorporated this in logistics processes, and
set up a dedicated call centre. Initially, customers could download the order list as a PDF and order by
phone or e-mail. The goods were prepared in the closed Coop City branches and registered on specially
converted tills. As time went on, Coop added more functions, including an order form for electronic orders.
IT introduces Office 365
As part of the upgrade of Office licences, Coop completed the switch to Office 365. The switch involved
7 500 users from administration, began at the end of 2019, and was completed in March 2020 – just in
time for lockdown and the Confederation’s recommendation to work from home. Very quickly, Office
365 and, in particular, the Teams platform – which can be used for video and voice calls from home,
chats, file sharing, the creation of task lists and so on – became an essential tool for Coop employees.
People working from home were also supported by additional technical capacities. In autumn 2020, the
roll-out of Office 365 began for the sales outlets, all of which now have a modern tool complete with the
hardware needed for video conferences.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Automated people counting system in sales outlets
Limiting customer numbers in stores was one Covid measure that Coop had to implement at very short
notice in March 2020. Within a few days, a “Coop Clicker App” was programmed and distributed to staff.
As a next step, Coop quickly evaluated and introduced an automated people counting system, which
uses sensors at entrances and exits to record people’s movements and indicates on a traffic light
whether the next person in the queue can enter the store. By the end of 2020, Coop had introduced
these people counting systems in around 560 sales outlets.
Sustainability in Coop real estate
Energy efficiency and the production of sustainable energy are key considerations for Coop when
planning and implementing its real estate projects. Therefore, all of Coop’s buildings meet the Minergie
requirements, and heating systems reliant on fossil fuels are no longer installed. 21 000 m2 of new
photovoltaic systems were installed in 2020 in line with the target.
Parking with Superpoints
Customers can use their Superpoints to pay parking charges in no fewer than 11 Coop car parks. They
also benefit from the automatic opening of the barriers when they enter and exit. The project will be
rolled out to more locations in 2021.
Digitalization of construction projects
Starting in 2020, all new construction projects are planned and delivered using BIM (Building Informa-
tion Modelling). Using virtual 3D prototyping, this method is used for the networked planning, execution
and management of projects. All the relevant construction data are digitally modelled, combined and
recorded. The project-specific BIM data provide an overview of the entire life cycle of a construction
project, and when construction is complete are used by Facility Management for maintenance.
Real estate projects
In 2020, Coop started a total of 7 real estate projects and completed 19, including 3 new builds, 1 ex-
tension, 6 remodels and 9 modernizations/renovations. The Covid pandemic had little impact on con-
struction activities and lead times.
Head Office Basel
On 18 December 2020, Coop concluded the complete renovation of its head office at Thiersteineralle 12
in Basel. The modernization involved upgrading office space on floors one to twelve, relocating the ca-
tering facilities and repurposing the area as office space on the 13th floor, a new catering area on the
ground floor of Thiersteinerallee 14, the complete replacement of technical installations and elevator
systems, and the replacement of the entire façade with 1 900 m2 of photovoltaic elements, which have
an output in excess of 82 000 kWh.
Aclens
The construction of the “Cinque” project in Aclens proceeded according to schedule in 2020. As part of
this logistics project, among other things a new building was constructed which will house a new
12 400 m2 empties collection centre, 8 300 m2 of new office space for the Romandie sales region, and a
Coop Restaurant . Energy will be generated by a waste heat utilization system and some of the electric-
ity requirements will be met by a 1 850 m2 roof-mounted photovoltaic unit. In June, a 57 metre-long,
125 tonne footbridge was also built between the existing distribution centre and the new building. The
new building will be commissioned in stages from July 2021. The distribution centre in La Chaux-de-
Fonds will close as of the end of September 2021 and the Renens one from the end of October 2021.
Oerlikon
After renovation work lasting 12 months, the Center Eleven shopping centre in Oerlikon celebrated its
reopening on 25 February 2020. In the shopping centre, customers will find 3 200 m2 of Coop retail
space, a 3 500 m2 Building & Hobby store, along with an Interdiscount, a Coop Restaurant, a newsstand
stocking a range of flowers, and a space occupied by a third-party tenant. The upgrade of the mall and
communal areas creates a light and friendly atmosphere. With LED lighting, an attractive new colour
scheme and electric charging stations, the shopping experience for customers begins in the under-
ground car park.

Lugano Pregassona
After 2 years under construction, in April 2020 the “Minerva” building in Lugano Pregassona was ready
for occupation. The 16 apartments are spread over four floors in the building, and all have a parking
space in the underground car park plus a separate cellar compartment. They have been built to modern
specifications, and are bright and flooded with light, making them highly sought-after on the housing
market. All the apartments have already been let.
Uzwil
After around 14 months of refurbishment work, the Coop shopping centre in Uzwil celebrated its full
reopening on 28 May 2020. In the mall area, along with the contemporary store format of Coop, Coop
Restaurant, Dropa Drogerie, Vögele Shoes and the Orru hair salon, customers can enjoy a complete
shopping experience. A new escalator connects the underground car park with the retail outlets, im-
proving customer access. The building meets the Minergie construction standard. The building’s outer
shell now has attractive timber cladding and energy supply is supported by a 2 200 m2 photovoltaic
system on the flat roof. Heating is supplemented by a highly efficient heat pump.
Castione
The sales outlet in Castione underwent a phased modernization between the start of May 2012 and mid-
2020, and the Coop retail space was increased to 1 500 m2. Architecturally, the building has a fresh,
timeless and elegant appearance thanks to the distinctive and protruding canopy construction and the
wooden façade. 1 100 m2 of photovoltaic panels have been mounted on the roof to generate electricity
and help reduce CO2 emissions.
Vich
The Coop in Vich opened on 19 August 2020. The former sales outlet has been remodelled, and the
Coop Retail space increased to 2 300 m2. The building also houses a Vitality pharmacy, a Coop Restau-
rant and a refurbished underground car park with 100 parking spaces for customers. Some of the elec-
tricity required is produced by a 1 500 m2 roof-mounted photovoltaic unit.
Le Noirmont
The Coop sales outlet in Le Noirmont opened for business on 25 November 2020. Right at the entrance
to the village, where there was once a filling station and an old barn, there is now a new, timber-clad
sales outlet with 480 m2 of Coop retail space and 23 outdoor parking spaces. On the upper floors are
12 apartments and a GP surgery. The new building was constructed to the Minergie standard and fitted
with 300 m2 of photovoltaic panels.
Broc
The Coop in Broc opened on 2 December 2020. On the site of what used to be a public car park, there is
now a new sales outlet with 420 m2 of Coop retail space and 18 outdoor parking spaces. On the upper
floors are 14 apartments.
Bévilard
The sales outlet in Bévilard celebrated its opening on 9 December 2020. From March 2020, a temporary
sales outlet was opened in the centre of the village, while part of the former sales outlet was demol-
ished. The Coop retail space was increased to 570 m2 and fitted with 300 m2 of photovoltaic panels on
the roof.

Additional services
Comprehensive quality management
In 2020, implementing the new food legislation remained a quality management priority, with further
changes as part of the Confederation’s so-called “Stretto” package. The ordinance necessitates chang-
es to the labelling of all products by 2021. As the basis for implementation, the Coop Guideline on La-
belling was revised. Among other things, the guideline stipulates how the origin of raw materials and
nutritional information are to be disclosed on Coop own-label brands. Coop’s disclosures regarding the
origin of animal-derived raw materials voluntarily exceed the legal requirements and are transparently
shown if they make up at least 10% of the food.
Since 2012, all sales outlets offering counter service have been audited and certified by independent
inspection body q.inspecta for compliance with quality requirements. A total of 407 sales outlets were
successfully audited in 2020. These audits were in addition to the 1 800 or so internal quality-control
audits conducted by Coop.
In its own laboratory, Coop tested around 31 000 random samples from the food and non-food seg-
ments for compliance with the requirements. This involved checking more than 915 000 criteria. Owing
to the growing supply of fresh products made at the sales outlets, hygiene monitoring is also becoming
ever more important in this area.
Even when faced with the difficulties created by Covid, stringent monitoring of key aspects of food and
product safety was maintained, demonstrating that we were able to uphold high quality standards at all
times.
As part of its risk management in the area of product quality, Coop devoted a great deal of time in 2020
to issues surrounding the safeguarding of the supply chain for critical raw materials. Furthermore, Coop
clarified the requirements for critical product groups in the non-food segment and made these available
to potential suppliers in automated form. Updated e-learning courses covering sales and purchasing
expertise were mandatory for employees throughout Switzerland.
Social commitment
Coop again pursued numerous projects that embodied its social commitment in 2020. Through the
Coop Sustainability Fund alone, Coop invested around 16.85 million francs in charitable projects. For
information about other projects besides those listed below, visit actions-not-words.ch
Commitment to Bio 2.0: 20 million invested in research projects so far
As early as 1993 Coop began working closely with the Research Institute for Organic Agriculture (FiBL).
To date, Coop has invested more than 21 million francs in numerous projects run by the FiBL and in
organic agriculture. This has enabled research into modern cultivation methods for organic cotton for
Naturaline textiles. The cooperation also helps establish substitute products for copper and, by making
targeted use of precision farming, ensure the financial viability of small-scale, diverse agriculture. Fur-
thermore, effective organic remedies are being created for citrus greening, a disease which affects or-
anges, so that customers can enjoy a glass of organic orange juice with their breakfast. With the help of
the FiBL, organic cultivation is also enabling Coop to make its coconut and palm oil more sustainable.
The partnership has also given rise to various products for the Naturaplan own-label brand, including
an award-winning organic Prosecco and Swiss organic honey.
Home delivery service with SRC during Covid
In the spring, during the pandemic, customers aged 65 and over were able to order food and hygiene
products by phone or e-mail from Coop City department stores and Coop supermarkets in a number of
towns and cities. Volunteer helpers from the Swiss Red Cross (SRC) delivered the orders to their homes
the next working day. The free delivery service was offered in Bern, Olten, Zurich and Lausanne.
Coop is enabling the rehabilitation of Alp Kohlschlag
This year, all of the proceeds from Coop’s “1 August rolls” campaign are going towards the remodelling
and expansion of Alp Kohlschlag in Mels, St. Gallen. Each year, the Alp processes around 125 000 litres
of milk and 18 000 kilograms of cheese. Investment in the alpine dairy, the cheese cellar and the resi-
dential building is urgently needed in order to safeguard this intensive alpine agriculture in future. Coop
is donating 304 657 francs to support the rehabilitation and expansion of the Alp. Coop Aid for Moun-
tain Regions has been dedicated tor better living and working conditions for the mountain populace for
over 75 years. Every franc donated goes entirely to self-help projects in the Swiss mountain region, as
all the administrative costs are borne by Coop.

Successful bioRe school projects.
Since 1995, under the Naturaline own-label brand Coop has been producing textiles from organic cotton
which are made for the range fairly, using environmentally-friendly methods and according to bioRe’s
social and environmental standard. For the right to an education and as part of the holistic Naturaline
approach, since 2011 Coop has been supporting three successful school projects in the central Indian
region Madhya Pradesh. These directly benefit the producers of organic cotton for Naturaline textiles
and the region’s farming communities. At present, more than 1 200 children of farming families and
disadvantaged children are taught in 18 village schools up to 5th grade. In 2014, a secondary school
was set up on the bioRe School Campus to provide follow-on education. 600 students currently attend
lessons there. The campus is also home to a state-recognized vocational training centre at which young
people have the opportunity to learn a locally relevant vocation such as mechanic, fashion designer, or
organic farmer.
“Blühende Schulen” flower planting project for schools
With the “Blühende Schulen” school project, in partnership with Bio Suisse Coop raised awareness of
treating nature with care while also promoting biodiversity. One approach involved planting flowers in
school gardens, creating new sources of food for bees and other insects. To this end, in the last five
years schools have been given 5 400 free planting kits containing organic herb seedlings and seeds for
native wild flowers. The project has raised awareness in 5 905 school classes and among 84 000 school
pupils, teachers, and helpers.
Full plates thanks to Tischlein deck dich and Schweizer Tafel
Since 2005, Coop has donated a considerable amount of date-expired food, which is still in perfect
condition but can no longer be sold, to the Schweizer Tafel (Swiss Table) and Tischlein deck dich (Table
Be Set) social organizations. They distribute the food to social institutions or directly to needy people in
Switzerland. By doing this, Coop fills more than 12.6 million plates of people in poverty (as of 2020).
Coop supports this commitment with donations of food and also financial contributions: each year,
around 2 510 tonnes of food and 300 000 francs are donated to the two organizations. In logistics,
Coop provided space in its warehouses free of charge, making a significant contribution towards reduc-
ing food waste.
Support for people in poverty with the “2xChristmas” campaign
Once again this year, Coop supported the “2xChristmas” campaign run by the Swiss Red Cross for peo-
ple in poverty in Switzerland. Coop sold around 8 000 donated parcels containing products worth
160 000 francs. Via Coop.ch, 1 059 parcels were sold, containing products worth 82 970 francs. In ad-
dition, Coop supported the campaign by donating products worth around 402 000 francs (retail value).
Coop supports Swiss Red Cross and helps people in need
The SRC is supporting people who have fallen on hard times due to the Covid pandemic. This includes
handing out Coop gift cards worth two million francs. Coop is additionally donated Coop gift cards
worth CHF 150 000. Furthermore, Coop encouraged readers of the Coop member press to use donation
coupons to donate money or Superpoints. In total, 2 617 coupons were redeemed over five weeks,
equating to a donation of CHF 74 450. Between April and June, Coop Supercard holders donated Super-
points worth CHF 98 500.
Communication and advertising
Customer Service replies to over 800 000 enquiries
Customer Service dealt with over 800 000 customer enquiries in 2020. As well as general questions
about Coop, the Coop Member Press and Supercard, the majority of our customers’ questions were
about Covid-related matters, such as restrictions on the range, which also affected our “Herb Garden
Adventure” marketing campaign. However, sustainability-related topics, in particular reducing plastic,
remain very important to our customers. Our marketing campaigns, advertising campaigns and collec-
tion promotions continue to attract a lot of interest. We are receiving a growing number of enquiries
about digital services (promotions, coupons). Pricing and range selection are still two of our customers’
main concerns.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
National information platform during Covid for all employees
In March, the employee information portal Coop.ch/gemeinsam was created, on which Coop has brought
together all the important information about the Covid situation. The platform ensured that the infor-
mation reached all employees in the sales outlets, logistics, production, administration and staff on
short-time working at home. In addition, Coop published pictures, videos, stories and statements from
its sales regions and formats on the site. During lockdown, the Coop Member Press also produced a
daily video format for employees. The “Coopzeitung bi de Lüt” format took the daily pulse of the Coop
Group and visited different people within the company. The editors asked how people were finding the
Covid situation and how they were coping with the major challenges.
Families benefit from loyalty programmes
Coop continued to reward its customers’ loyalty in 2020, with a total of four collection promotions.
Once again, the focus was on families with children, who enjoyed free products. The “Herb Garden Ad-
venture” and “Wilderness Adventure” promotions, in partnership with the WWF, turned the spotlight on
sustainability issues. The Hello Summer promotion with products related to water was a hit with cus-
tomers. During the Christmas build-up, for the first time Coop took an integrated approach with Coop’s
Christmas communication team, telling the story of “Nevi the snow monster” in its “Let it snow” cam-
paign. All four promotions proved extremely popular, generating substantial additional sales.
Supercard remains very popular
The Supercard remains the most-used and most popular loyalty programme in Switzerland. Coop is
continuously refining the Supercard as a service brand, offering its customers more and more new ser-
vices relating to the Supercard, including digital ones, which offer added value for customers.
New staff magazine to mark anniversary
The Coop Group’s staff magazine is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a relaunch: as well as the lay-
out, the concept has also had a complete overhaul. The old name “Coop Forte magazine” has been
shortened to “Forte”. “Forte” now has a more modern appeal, with more images and more diverse con-
tent. Strategic topics also feature more heavily and there is a greater focus on the regional sections.
Furthermore, its handy format and modern editorial design are designed to appeal more to younger
employees.
Social media adds more channels and keeps people informed during Covid
The Covid pandemic also had a big impact on social media. In spring, for instance, the social media
team responded swiftly to what was going on in the Coop supermarkets and actively informed social
media users about rules, changes, and safety concepts, as well as responding to customer questions
                                                           and feedback. The merger of Coop.ch and
                                                           coop@home also presents new opportunities

                                                           for e-commerce on the social channels. In ad-
                                                           dition, the channels were expanded: Hello
                                                           Family is now on Instagram too and, in Janu-
                 years                                     ary, Coop became one of the first Swiss com-
                                                           panies to have a TikTok presence, enabling it
“Forte” staff magazine                                     to respond even more specifically to the vari-
                                                           ous target groups.
Coop and 20 Minuten jointly launch “Coopzeitung Weekend”
The Coop Member Press which, with around 3.2 million readers (WEMF Mach-Basic 2020-2) is the big-
gest weekly newspaper, and 20 Minuten which, with over 1.8 million readers (WEMF Mach-Basic 2020-2
is the most widely-read daily newspaper, are launching a magazine to get the weekend off to a perfect
start: “Coopzeitung Weekend”. The newspaper is published once a week, on Friday, as a 16-page paper
within a paper, in the centrefold of 20 Minuten. “Coopzeitung Weekend” delivers lifestyle and trend
topics to the young and young-at-heart. With content such as creative recipes, lifestyle and sustainabil-
ity tips, ideas, competitions and puzzles and a layout based on the Coop Member Press, the newspaper
is geared primarily towards a young target group. The articles are written by the new Weekend editorial
team, comprised of journalists from the German, Italian and French language editions of the Coop Mem-
ber Press. Ad sales are also handled by Coop.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Coop Member Press publishes special pages on Covid
During lockdown, the three Coop Member Press publications published lots of special pages of useful
information from Coop on the subject of Covid, as well as tips, puzzles, games, and special articles for
anyone who had to stay home and was in need of some distraction.
Cooking fun for children during Covid
In March, during lockdown, Coop launched “Little Fooby”, a recipe platform for parents to cook and bake
with their kids. What is unique about Little Fooby is that the recipes show which cooking steps can be
carried out by the children themselves and the tasks for which they need their parents’ help. After just
a short time, Little Fooby has become very popular with parents of young children.
Coop Mobile Plus: the new, unlimited subscription
In September, Coop launched “Coop Mobile Plus”, a new and attractive mobile subscription, which of-
fers customers unlimited phone calls, messaging and browsing in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. To
mark the launch of “Coop Mobile Plus”, when a new subscription was taken out, Coop gifted six months
of charges and offers attractive discounts on all smartphones at Interdiscount and Fust. In December,
Coop introduced a particularly attractive flat-rate package for employees of the Coop Group. Since
2019, Coop Mobile has been using the Swisscom network, which is regarded as the best in Switzerland.
Sponsorship in the great outdoors
The sponsorship sector was particularly badly hit by the Covid rules in 2020. As Coop sponsorship com-
mitments such as the Coop Gemeindeduell events and the Coop Open Air Cinemas took place outdoors,
they went ahead successfully with the appropriate safety measures in place. Unfortunately, many of
Coop’s sponsorship projects had to be cancelled or postponed to 2021 because of the strict regulations
imposed by the Confederation.
Media Unit: Covid pandemic dominated
As one of Switzerland’s most relevant media offices, Coop’s Media Unit further intensified dialogue with
journalists in 2020. Consequently, heavy media coverage of Coop news continued in the year under re-
view. The appointment of Joos Sutter as the new Chairman of Coop’s Board of Directors and the an-
nouncement of the new Chairman of the Executive Committee attracted particularly great interest in the
media. Journalists also reported widely on the launch of the new omnichannel platform Coop.ch. Sus-
tainability-wise, communication priorities were reducing plastics, the circular economy, and hydrogen.
The number one topic in media work as, of course, the Covid pandemic, attracting a record of 250 media
enquiries a week. During the year under review, Coop’s Media Unit issued 30 media releases, placed
close to 50 new and proactive topics, gave and attended around 100 interviews and responded to 2 769
media enquiries – a new record, and an increase of over 1 100 enquiries compared with the previous
year.

Wholesale/Production
Business Area
The Transgourmet Group’s wholesale supply business
has been badly hit by the closure of catering estab-
lishments during Covid and specifically promotes sus-
tainable products. Bell consolidates its position on the
convenience market. Coop’s manufacturing compa-
nies cope with high demand in supermarkets during
the pandemic.
                                          The Covid pandemic is leaving its mark on the industries that
12.6
                                          supply retailers and the catering segment. Thanks to the strong
                                          performance of food retail, Coop’s manufacturing companies
                                          were able to offset much of the dwindling demand in the cater-
                        billion CHF
                                          ing segment. Food wholesale suffered sharp drops in sales as a
                                          result of the Covid measures imposed on restaurants and
Net sales in Wholesale                    events. In spite of everything, the Coop Group’s Wholesale/Pro-
and Production                            duction business area generated net sales in excess of 12.6 bil-
                                          lion francs in 2020, which corresponds to an index of 92.1%,
                                          after adjustment for exchange rates.
Transgourmet Group
With subsidiary Transgourmet Holding AG, the Coop Group is active in the cash & carry and wholesale
supplies market in Germany, Poland, Romania, Russia, France, Austria and Switzerland. Like all whole-
salers, Transgourmet had to contend with the impact of the Covid pandemic. As a result, in 2020 it
generated net sales of 8.1 billion francs from its cash & carry stores and wholesale supplies, which
equates to an index of 86.7% in local currency. Nonetheless, Transgourmet was able to further consol-
idate its position as the second-biggest in European wholesale over the last year. Transgourmet gener-
ated sales of 315 million francs from sustainable ranges in 2020. In response to high customer demand,
these ranges will be further expanded in 2021.
Challenging Covid situation at Transgourmet
As all of Transgourmet’s customers are affected by the impact of the pandemic, Covid is also taking a
toll on all of the Transgourmet Group’s business areas and companies. The closure of schools, cancel-
lation of cultural and sporting events and restriction of opening hours in restaurants, bars and cafés
had potentially devastating consequences for restaurant proprietors and for caterers and hotel owners.
Their suppliers are also faced with a dire financial situation. On top of this, large companies had to tem-
porarily shut their factories. As a result, canteens and company restaurants also remained closed. The
picture was similar in aviation and shipping. Passenger food and drink dwindled to a fraction of former
volumes. At this difficult time, the in-store business, which became far more significant, delivered pos-
itive results at Transgourmet. The guidelines and requirements varied from one country to the next. All
of Transgourmet’s national subsidiaries swiftly took the measures necessary to protect employees and
customers during this difficult time and helped Transgourmet to safeguard supplies to all partners.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Standardized rules with an international code of conduct
In 2020, the Transgourmet Group introduced a code of conduct for all countries which has applied to the
Coop Group’s other business areas for the last year. The rules and guidelines derived from the code of
conduct give employees clarity and guidance in their daily work routines. As well as employee interac-
tion, they also cover topics such as “respect for human rights”, “customer service”, “fair treatment of
business partners”, “sustainability” and “compliance with laws”. The direction provided by, and compli-
ance with these guidelines are the foundation for actively embracing the company’s values and operat-
ing successfully on the market. In this sense, the code of conduct exemplifies the culture that has pre-
vailed at Transgourmet for many years.
New organic own-label brand Natura
Compared with retail, organic produce still accounts for a small percentage of national and internation-
al wholesale, but demand for organic products is steadily growing in this segment too. Therefore, Trans-
gourmet decided to create the new organic own-label brand Natura, which it has launched at four na-
tional subsidiaries. Natura is Transgourmet’s targeted and comprehensive response to the organic
trend and establishes a distinctive presence on the market. The first products were added to the range
in October 2020, with the official launch to follow in 2021. Around 200 products are planned for the new
brand. The goal is to position Transgourmet Natura in the western European partner countries as a wide,
organic full range and to offer impressive value for money. Natura is the equivalent of the value for mon-
ey segment of own-label brand Quality but is also organic.
Transgourmet Germany committed to combating food waste
The avoidance of food waste – whether generated by private households, out-of-home catering, whole-
sale and retail or agriculture – is and remains an important social goal. Transgourmet is also aware of
the great economic and environmental importance of this topic: worldwide, roughly a third of all food
goes to waste en route from field to plate. Since June of this year, Transgourmet Germany has lent its
support to the wholesale and retail dialogue forum established by the Federal Ministry of Food and Ag-
riculture (BMEL). As a member of this forum, it undertakes to treat foodstuffs responsibly, reduce food
waste, and do more to protect the climate. The BMEL’s wholesale and retail dialogue forum was estab-
lished as part of the national strategy to cut food waste in German wholesale and retail by half by 2030.
In addition, Transgourmet is a founding member of the global food industry alliance United Against
Waste.
Transgourmet France committed to regional products
To satisfy growing demand, as part of its sustainability concept Transgourmet France is committed to
building the most complete range possible of local and regional products (fresh produce, overseas pro-
duce, beverages, frozen food and meat). This range is intended to meet the expectations of all custom-
ers while also helping them to satisfy the new legal requirements. In particular, under the “EGalim Act”,
from 2022 onwards public food service businesses must offer meals which contain a minimum of 50%
high-quality, sustainable products, 20% of them organically produced. Already, Transgourmet France’s
3 000 or so local and regional products account for 5% of its sales and the company intends to double
this in the near future.

First vegan burger in the range
Vegetarian and vegan foods are always extremely popular in the catering segment too. Transgourmet is
responding to this trend and launching the first plant-based burger under own-label brand Transgourmet
Quality, based on pure plant proteins with no compromise on taste and enjoyment. I
Transgourmet Digital Magazin launches
Transgourmet Digital Magazin breaks new communication ground for Transgourmet in the food sector.
The authors identify trending topics and exciting concepts in catering and public food service, and explore
them in depth. The new magazine places the focus on customer benefit, delivering relevant content.
Each issue is devoted to a special subject which is geared towards all distribution channels and actively
involves the stakeholders in those channels. Practical visionaries discuss propositions for the future
and talk to practitioners from all segments of the out-of-home market. Interviews and author contribu-
tions are supplemented with podcasts and videos.
Several accolades for Frischeparadies
Frischeparadies, a subsidiary of the Transgourmet Group, is synonymous with premium quality for pro-
fessionals, amateur chefs and gourmets. Its range comprises over 3 000 of the finest foods – from fish,
seafood, meat, poultry, cheese and ham to the finest chocolate and exceptional wines. Frischeparadies
won multiple awards in Germany in 2020. The online shop was named a “Leading Shop of the Year
2020” in the foods and drugstores category, won the “German Brand Award 2020” for the own-label
Frischeparadies brand in the “Excellence in Brand Strategy and Creation Brand Design” category, and
triumphed in the awards for Wine Merchant of the Year 2020. Frischeparadies’ website also drew praise,
receiving an award in the “Excellent Communications Design Web” category.

Production
Bell Food Group
Thanks to its broad-based business model, the Bell Food Group had a successful financial year in 2020
in overall terms and made clear progress at the operating level. The upturn was attributable to the
strategic measures implemented in previous years. In addition, the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis –
coupled with the impact of the government measures taken to contain it – had a substantial influence
on business.
Challenges met
During the pandemic, Bell Food Group focused its attention on protecting the health of its employees
and at the same time being a reliable partner to its customers. Comprehensive protection and hygiene
measures were put in place at all sites. Thanks to the unstinting efforts of its employees, the Bell Food
Group nevertheless succeeded in maintaining production and delivery readiness at all times.
Contrasting impacts of the coronavirus pandemic
The government measures taken to contain the coronavirus pandemic significantly affected consumer
behaviour. Restrictions on mobility, coupled with the temporary closure of the catering sector, meant that
food service and the to-go segment – which had been expanding in recent years – had to contend with a
significant fall in sales. At the same time, the retail business benefited from the fact that consumers
were increasingly eating at home.
Growth in core business
The core business in meat and meat products benefited from the higher sales in the retail market. This
was particularly the case in Switzerland, where the temporary abandonment of shopping tourism
during the lockdown provided an additional boost. In the Bell Switzerland business area, encouraging
growth in the retail market more than offset the decline in sales in the food service segment. The Bell
International business area likewise saw a significant improvement in results thanks to its consistent
pursuit of the strategy adopted after the sale of the German sausage business of focusing on its core
competency in cured ham and further expansion of poultry programmes that meet higher animal welfare
standards. By contrast, the Convenience business area was more heavily impacted by the negative
effects of the coronavirus pandemic due to its greater focus on out-of-home consumption as well as to-go
in the retail segment. In contrast with the other business areas, the decline in sales was only partially
compensated via the retail channel.
Well equipped for the future
In addition to the special efforts invested in the operating business last year, the Bell Food Group revised
its strategic focus and adjusted it to the coming challenges. Three strategic thrusts were defined for
implementation: Strengthen the core business of meat products, achieve growth through convenience
and vegetarian, and invest in efficiency and productive capacity.

High demand for Steinfels Swiss disinfectants during Covid pandemic
As a manufacturer of product solutions for cleanliness, disinfection and hand hygiene, Steinfels Swiss
was in particular demand across all customer segments during Covid. Although shortages of alcohol as
a raw ingredient presented a challenge over the course of the year, Steinfels Swiss upped its production
to 3 shifts, 24 hours a day in order to cope with the high market demand. The manufacture of disinfect-
                                                      ants was completely overhauled and output in-
                                                      creased almost 32-fold within a very short period.
Around 1862
of disinfectant produced
                                      tonnes
                                                      At the same time, Steinfels Swiss developed and
                                                      successfully launched new disinfectant ranges,
                                                      which were approved and introduced. There was
                                                      also significant growth in sales of professional hy-
                                                      giene products. Thanks to its outstanding sustaina-
                                                      bility credentials, Steinfels Swiss also won a num-
                                                      ber of national large and chain customers.
Swissmill supplies the population with grain
In 2020, Swissmill milled over 225 000 tonnes of grain and produced more than 100 different types of
flour and semolina, as well as flakes, mixes and speciality products. Due to lockdown, there was more
hoarding of staple foods, placing severe strain on the retailer – food processor – raw material supplier
supply chain. Owing to this high demand for staple foods, the Swiss mills operated around the clock in
the spring. It was especially vital to meet as much of the huge additional demand from retail as possible.
Pasta was also very popular, quickly selling in record quantities during the pandemic. Swissmill made a
Herculean effort to keep product and deliveries going during this challenging time, and was able to safe-
guard the supply to the population at all times.
Chocolats Halba/Sunray successful on the Asian market
The Asian markets led the way for Chocolats Halba/Sunray in 2020: despite the Covid pandemic, growth
in exports to China was particularly strong. Although Chocolate consumption is gaining in popularity in
China,, with per capita consumption of around 100 grams a year, it is still very low. By way of compari-
son, annual pro capita consumption of chocolate in Switzerland is around 11 kilograms. In 2020, Choc-
olats Halba/Sunray succeeded in hitting the right flavour note for the Chinese market, with an innovative
chocolate: in contrast to products on the shelves in Chinese stores, the high percentage of cocoa and
Swiss alpine milk contained in the new chocolates by Chocolats Halba/Sunray, and their sugar-free rec-
ipe, go down well with Chinese consumers. The chocolate from Pratteln was placed, as planned, in
100 000 Chinese stores and a wide variety of online and offline sales channels. Furthermore, Chocolats
Halba/Sunray has taken account of the biggest environmental trend in China by making its packaging
plastic-free. This product by Chocolats Halba/Sunray is a response to the trend for sustainable and
contemporary chocolate on the Asian market, and is perfectly in keeping with the consumer mood.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Employees
Employees go above and beyond during Covid and
show a lot of solidarity. Coop promotes digital learning
platforms, which employees use for self-study to gain
valuable knowledge. By launching the one-year basic
apprenticeship, Coop opens up new avenues in voca-
tional training and is certified for its equal pay.
                                          The Covid pandemic placed great demands on all employees of
90 825
                                          the Coop Group, and their flexible and unbureaucratic response
                                          to the exceptional situation was very impressive. Along with
                                          their great commitment in all areas, there was also a strong
                                          sense of solidarity across all the different formats. During lock-
                                          down, many employees from the temporarily closed trading for-
employees of                              mats, catering and wholesale helped their colleagues in the su-
the Coop Group                            permarkets, production and logistics. Their assistance went a
                                          long way towards fulfilling the mandate to uphold supplies and
                                          to protecting employees and customers at all times. Other em-
ployees had to switch to short-time working. Coop made good the 20% drop in pay that this entailed for
them. Furthermore, in line with the FOPH recommendation, Coop ordered its employees in administra-
tion to work from home. Thanks to the flexibility of staff and of the IT systems, business processes were
maintained at all times. The unparalleled dedication shown by everyone involved enabled us to cope
with the difficulties encountered and, against all the odds, place the focus squarely on customers’
needs. Coop paid all of its employees a special bonus for their outstanding commitment during Covid.
In 2020, the Coop Group had a total of 90 825 employees in the Retail and Wholesale/Production busi-
ness areas, including 3 365 apprentices. In the year under review, 63.3% of jobs were in Switzerland
and the remainder abroad. Coop plays an important integrative role in society, by employing people of
all educational levels and nationalities.
The latest developments on the labour market make sustainable HR work a challenging task. Chief
among those developments are the skills shortage, growing competition for qualified employees and
rapid technological advances. Demographic change, particularly with regard to the low birth rate gener-
ations and the retirement of baby boomers, also requires companies to be highly adaptable. Profession-
al activity is far more significant among women, the world of work is becoming increasingly multicultur-
al, and working models are becoming more flexible. In this environment, the Coop Group positions itself
as a diverse, attractive and sustainable employer. This is particularly important in order to attract and
then retain the best qualified job-seekers as employees.
In its HR work, the Coop Group’s strategic priorities are: attractiveness as an employer, enterprise and
management and change management. One of the main aims of Coop’s HR work, besides recruiting new
staff members, is to enthuse employees for and impart to them the skills they need in order to deal with
technological change and digitalization.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Attractiveness as an employer
CPV/CAP Coop Pension Fund still making very stable progress
Despite the very tough and volatile environment, the CPV/CAP Coop Pension Fund generated a positive
return of 3.9%. The target yield was thus exceeded and, as at 31.12.2020, the funding ratio had risen to
118.2% (previous year 116.1%); the target for the funding ratio is 115.0%. The old-age pension assets
of active members accrued interest of 2.0% in 2020. This is twice the level of the minimum interest rate
under Swiss law. The provisional interest rate for 2021 is 2.0%. Pensions remained unchanged, and this
will also be the case in 2021. At 38 431, the number of active members was slightly higher than the pre-
vious year (37 266 active members). The number of pensioners rose by 224 people to 20 712 at the end
of 2020.
Transgourmet France named one of the best employers in 2020
For the second year in a row, the French edition of the magazine “Capital” chose Transgourmet France
as one of France’s best employers in 2020. In the “Wholesale” category, Transgourmet took 17th place
(out of 98) in the ranking, for which an independent survey institute surveyed 20 000 people at compa-
nies across France with more than 500 employees.
Training and staff development
Introduction of more digital technology in Human Resources
HR continued to adopt new digital technologies in 2020, with the introduction of more SAP SuccessFac-
tors modules. This move eradicated various paper-based processes for Coop, such as recording targets,
the employee performance review, and the pay negotiation. In the area of learning, more than 450 inter-
nal training courses are now available online. The Coop Access app, which was launched in 2020, ena-
bles all employees, including those without a PC workstation, to easily, quickly and securely access the
Coop network and, with it, numerous Coop applications such as the Coop address book, mobile deploy-
ment planning, or SuccessFactors. In addition, the new PEP 2 staff deployment planning tool offers line
managers new, contemporary planning options with straightforward graphic tools.
Coop Campus: New avenues in vocational training
On 1 August, Coop launched its new action-oriented and forward-looking training concept. In its first
year, 616 apprentices completed the basic training in 2020. Basic sales outlets and basic trainers were
identified in the supermarkets sales channel, to provide training for 8 to 12 apprentices in the first year.
After this, the young people move to a training sales outlet. The rapid pace of change in the world of
work makes it vital for apprentices to independently acquire new knowledge and new skills. Self-regulat-
ed and self-organized learning is therefore pivotal to the new concept. The government’s strategic
guidelines for “Vocational Training 2030”require graduate apprentices to also demonstrate responsible
professional actions in specific situations. Therefore, in its Coop Campus basic training Coop promotes
traits such as individual responsibility, enthusiasm, an action mindset and being a role model.
Digital learning media for practical assignments “beook” app and Coopilot learning management system
Since 2020, apprentices have been using the new digital learning media training concept to complete
and reflect on their practical assignments. They prepare documentation on the individual practical as-
signments in their personal “beook” app, supplement these with video, audio and image files, and sub-
mit them to the vocational trainers using a notebook or smartphone. For their part, the trainers work on
a learning management system which apprentices have christened “Coopilot”. Using a practical check-
list, apprentices rate their own competencies. Every three months, in addition to their self-perception,
they receive a third-party evaluation from their vocational trainers, which is discussed in detail and ad-
justed as necessary. This means that each apprentice has their own portfolio of competencies and
skills.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Live online training courses and webinars
Covid has also left its mark on training. Suddenly, in-person training in seminar rooms was no longer
possible and various courses run by the Coop Campus had to be switched online, so they could be at-
tended from any location. The platforms used to achieve this were Teams, Webex and Adobe Connect.
The popular Meet & Eat lunch events which took place in the auditorium at head office, and were rou-
tinely attended by up to 100 participants, continued as a webinar. This has made it easy for employees
from the regions to enjoy exciting content.
CAS Management and Leadership
Thanks to a partnership with the Kalaidos University of Applied Sciences, employees now have the op-
tion of obtaining a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) on completion of their management training at
Coop. The first 13 participants will be awarded their UAS certificate and 15 ECTS points in March 2021.
The CAS in Management and Leadership is comprised of a combination of modules, self-regulated
learning, transfer tasks and a practical case study. With its practical orientation, this part-time training
enables participants to really engage with what they have learned in their daily management activities,
increasing their self-efficacy. Coop’s new offering is very popular with employees: with 15 participants,
the second CAS intake also got off to a successful start.
Equal pay certification
At the start of April 2020, the Swiss Association for Quality and Management (SQS) awarded Coop the
“Fair Compensation” certification for the Coop business units. The “Fair Compensation” certificate
confirms that Coop’s remuneration policy satisfies the criteria for compliance with fair compensation.
Coop has been tackling this issue for a number of years, and has now become the first big Swiss retail-
er to be rewarded for its commitment with the certificate - proof that, at Coop, all employees have the
same opportunities, regardless of gender or background.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Corporate governance
Corporate governance is based on the principle of
management’s transparency and openness towards
employees and the general public. In the following
chapter, Coop provides an insight into its company
structure.
The Coop Group Cooperative is committed to openness and transparency in the operational manage-
ment of the Group and it acts to ensure good corporate governance in the interests of its members,
customers, employees and other stakeholders. Its governance largely follows the guidelines of SIX
Swiss Exchange regarding information on corporate governance. These apply to joint-stock companies
and companies that have issued participation certificates or non-voting dividend rights certificates,
which does not apply to Coop as a cooperative society. The only company in the Coop Group that has
issued SIX-listed equities is Bell Food Group AG. For specific information on this company’s corporate
governance, see its annual report and website, www.bellfoodgroup.com.
Group structure
The Coop Group Cooperative is based in Basel. At the end of 2020 the cooperative had over 2.5 million
members. Any resident of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein can become a member. The
Coop Group Cooperative holds stakes in a number of companies in Switzerland and abroad. Pages 116
to 119 of the Annual Report (Scope of consolidation) provide information on the group structure. There
are no cross-holdings within the Coop Group. The Coop Group Cooperative is responsible for the gener-
al direction of business of the Coop Group. The executive bodies of the Coop Group Cooperative are the
Regional Councils, Delegate Assembly, Board of Directors, Executive Committee and auditors.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Regional Councils
The Coop Group Cooperative comprises six regions (Suisse Romande, Bern, Nordwestschweiz, Zen-
tralschweiz-Zurich, Ostschweiz incl. Principality of Liechtenstein, and Ticino). These regions do not con-
stitute separate legal entities, but are part of the Coop Group’s cooperative-based organizational struc-
ture. In each region, cooperative members elect a Regional Council consisting of 60 to 120 members
(Ticino: maximum of 30). The Regional Councils maintain contact with members and the public. Each
Regional Council appoints a Committee of twelve (Ticino: six) from among its members. Each Commit-
tee is self-constituting and submits a proposal to the Board of Directors for the attention of the Delegate
Assembly for one of its members to be appointed to the Board of Directors; if elected, the member be-
comes President of both the Regional Council (RC) and its Committee (RCC). The other members of the
Regional Council Committee are the delegates. They represent the members of the corresponding re-
gion at the Delegate Assembly of the Coop Group Cooperative. The current composition of the Delegate
Assembly is shown in the section “Delegate Assembly”.
The term of office of the Regional Councils and the Regional Council Committees is four years. The cur-
rent term of office is from 2017 to 2021. According to the Articles of Association, a member’s term in
office is limited to 20 years, and members must retire at the end of the year in which they turn 65. Start-
ing from the 2021 to 2025 term of office, the age restriction will be raised to age 70.
Delegate Assembly
The Delegate Assembly is endowed with the legal powers vested in the Annual General Meeting and the
duties assigned to it in the Articles of Association. In particular, it is responsible for laying down the
Articles of Association, electing and dismissing the Board of Directors and the statutory auditors, ap-
proving the Annual Report, discharging the Board of Directors and dissolving the cooperative society. In
addition, the Board of Directors can submit other business to it for a decision.
Further information on the Regional Councils and the Delegate Assembly can be found in the Articles of
Association and the Election Regulations of the Coop Group Cooperative. Both documents can be ac-
cessed online.

Delegate Assembly in the year in which they celebrate their 65th birthday.
First-time election and remaining term of office
The start of the term of office for members of the Board of Directors elected for the first time is set out
in the section “Members of the Board of Directors”. The current term of office began in spring 2017 and
ends in spring 2021.
Internal organization
Allocation of tasks within the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is self-constituting, appointing a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman from among its
members. The members assume equal responsibility for exercising the functions of the Board of Directors.
Audit Committee
As support, the Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee from among its own members.
The Audit Committee advises the Board of Directors on questions concerning the financial statements
and reporting, on the activities of the internal and external auditors, the internal control system (ICS)
and risk management. Compliance is also a matter for the internal control system and risk management.
The Audit Committee meets at least three times a year. A meeting generally lasts half a day. As a rule,
the Chairman of the Executive Committee (CEO), the Head of the Finance Business Unit and the Head of
Internal Auditing take part in the meetings in an advisory capacity. Depending on the agenda of the
meeting, the external auditors may be asked to attend. The members of the Board of Directors are kept
informed on the work of the Audit Committee at regular intervals. Internal Auditing reports to the Chair-
woman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee met four times in 2020.
Working method of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors meets as often as business requires, but at least four times a year. As a rule, the
Chairman of the Executive Committee (CEO) and the Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee take
part (for all items on the agenda) in the meetings of the Board of Directors in an advisory capacity, as
do the other members of the Executive Committee if required. The Board is quorate if a majority of its
members are present. A valid decision requires a majority of the votes cast. In the event of a tie, the
Chairman of the Board of Directors has the casting vote.
In 2020, the Board of Directors convened for eight meetings lasting from one to two days. No external
consultants were engaged.
Regulation of responsibilities
The Board of Directors is responsible for the general direction (strategic leadership) of the business of
the Coop Group Cooperative and the Coop Group and oversees operational management of the Group.
The duties and powers vested in it under Art. 29 of the Articles of Association correspond to the regula-
tions laid down for joint-stock companies (Swiss Code of Obligations 716a), which are stricter than
Swiss law on cooperatives. The organizational regulations enacted by the Board of Directors provide for
a strict division of responsibilities between the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee in all
fundamental matters such as finance, corporate strategy, human resources and organization. The Ex-
ecutive Committee has drawn up regulations that define in detail the operational responsibilities of the
individual management levels.

Instruments of information and control over the Executive Committee
Management information system
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the CEO meet once or twice a month to discuss fundamental
issues regarding the Coop Group. The Chairman of the Board of Directors regularly attends the meetings
of the Executive Committee. At each regular meeting of the Board of Directors, the CEO informs the Board
members in detail about the company’s performance, key projects and events as well as measures that
have been implemented. Every month the Board of Directors receives a written report containing key
figures on current business performance and important information on all business segments. In addi-
tion, reports and results are submitted in writing to the Board of Directors every four months and pre-
sented and discussed at the Board meetings.
Planning and goal-setting process/balanced scorecard
Coop has a comprehensive and continuous planning and goal-setting process in place, which also fea-
tures regular reporting to the Board of Directors, including balanced scorecard reports.
Risk management
The Coop Group operates a standardized risk management system. Every three years (most recently in
2018), the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors identify and analyse the main risks and main
risk scenarios and determine the appropriate measures. The progress made in implementing the indi-
vidual measures is reviewed each year. Major risks are defined as those that can have a negative impact
on the EBIT of the Coop Group to the extent of over 15 million francs within three years.
Internal control system
During the well-established annual quality evaluation of the internal control system at business process
level, operational risks and risks associated with financial reporting and compliance are assessed. The
effectiveness of the checks carried out to cover these risks is also assessed. General IT checks are in-
cluded in the above assessments.
The quality of the Group-wide checks is examined by members of the Executive Committee every two
years. As scheduled, an assessment of the Group-wide checks was carried out in 2019. The results of
the internal control system evaluations are summarized in a comprehensive report issued each year.
Internal Auditing
Internal Auditing - as an independent and impartial body - is mandated by the Board of Directors and
the Audit Committee to check compliance with guidelines and regulations, the appropriateness and
effectiveness of the internal control system and other aspects. It audits, or advises on, the development
of new business processes or changes to existing ones, and supports the Executive Committee in the
achievement of its goals by presenting proposals for improving business processes. Internal Auditing
practises a risk-oriented approach to auditing. Observations from audits are communicated in writing
to the Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of
the Executive Committee. The implementation of measures is monitored promptly. Internal Auditing
coordinates its auditing activities and maintains close contact with the statutory auditors for the pur-
pose of sharing information. It is a member of the Institute of Internal Auditing Switzerland (IIAS).
Compliance
Coop’s corporate profile takes shape with the Coop Group Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, which
is binding on the company’s employees, describes the rules when dealing with each other, as well as
with our customers and business partners. It focuses on a respectful, non-discriminatory, sincere and
honest approach. This includes compliance with statutory requirements and internal guidelines. Viola-
tions of this Code of Conduct should initially be reported to line managers. In cases where this is not
possible, the person reporting the violation can contact a reporting office. All information is treated as
strictly confidential.

Compensation
Content and method of determining compensation and shareholding programmes
Compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of the Coop Group
Cooperative is prepared by the Chairman and the Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Directors and set by
the Board of Directors.
Compensation of the activities of the Board of Directors of the Coop Group Cooperative consists of a
fixed salary dependent on the function involved (chairmanship, vice-chairmanship, regional council
chairmanship, membership). In addition, a variable amount is paid in the form of fees for attending
meetings. The Chairman and the Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Directors and Doris Leuthard are
exceptions in that they receive fixed compensation (annual lump sum).
Compensation of the members of the Executive Committee of the Coop Group Cooperative consists of
a contractually agreed fixed gross salary and a variable performance-related sum (profit-sharing) paid
in cash. This sum may not exceed 20% of gross salary and is determined by the degree of budget fulfil-
ment.
Compensation for the activities of the Board of Directors of the Coop Group Cooperative, the Coop
Cooperative and Coop Immobilien AG in 2020 amounted to 1.4 million francs in 2020 (previous year:
1.3 million francs). The gross salaries of the Executive Committee totalled 4.2 million francs for seven
full-time equivalents in 2020 (previous year: 4.2 million francs for seven full-time equivalents). The
Coop Group Cooperative and the Coop Cooperative, respectively, are entitled to any fees paid to the
Chairman and the Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Directors and to members of the Executive
Committee for activities performed as members of the Boards of Directors of subsidiaries.
The Chairman and the Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Directors and the members of the Executive
Committee do not enjoy special pension rights.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Auditors
Duration of mandate and term of office of lead auditor
As the auditors are appointed for one year, the Delegate Assembly elects the auditors each year. KPMG
has been the auditor of the Coop Group Cooperative and of the consolidated financial statements of the
Coop Group since 2019. Lead auditor Jurg Meisterhans has been in office since 2019.
Auditing fee
The auditors billed fees totalling 3.4 million francs for fulfilment of their statutory mandate for the 2020
financial year.
Other fees
For performing additional services over and above the statutory mandate, the auditors billed a total of
0.7 million francs during the 2020 financial year.
Information instruments pertaining to an external audit
The Audit Committee is mandated by the Board of Directors to monitor the qualification, impartiality
and performance of the external auditors and to inform the Board of Directors of the results of its as-
sessment. It also provides the Board of Directors and the Delegate Assembly with a recommendation
regarding the election or re-election of the external auditors.
The lead auditor took part in three meetings of the Audit Committee in 2020. Planning of the audit, the
observations of the external auditors and the ensuing procedure adopted were discussed at these meet-
ings. In addition, the lead auditor reports to all members of the Board of Directors once a year. The ex-
ternal auditors and Internal Auditing additionally discuss the methods and further development of the
internal control system.
Information policy
The Coop Group Cooperative keeps its members informed through the weekly Coop Member Press and
the Coop websites. In addition, members can view the Coop Annual Report on the company’s website or
download it from the website.
    report.coop.ch
In spring and autumn, the delegates attend Delegate Assemblies at which information about ongoing
business developments is provided and current topics are discussed in depth. Along with the invitation
to the Spring Delegate Assembly they also receive a copy of the Annual Report of the Coop Group. The
financial statements of the Coop Group Cooperative are an integral component of this annual report. In
addition, they receive a written report every four months informing them of Coop’s current business
performance.
The key sales figures for the previous year are announced at the beginning of each year, and the annual
results conference of the Coop Group takes place in February. Regular media releases keep the public
informed on other important developments within the Coop Group.

The Coop Group’s statement of added value shows the added value created by the Group in a given year and how it is used. The Coop Group aims to
create added value on a sustainable basis, thereby enabling it to safeguard the Group companies and jobs.
At 73.1% (previous year: 73.3%), the largest proportion of the newly created value goes to the Coop Group’s employees. The Coop Group employed
78 578 FTE (previous year: 78 118).
The public sector receives 16.8% (previous year: 17.0%) from taxes, customs duties and charges.
The 0.7% (previous year: 0.6%) going to investors comprises interest paid. Due to low interest rates, this remains at a relatively low level.
Adequate profits are retained for self-financing purposes and used to safeguard the Group’s continued existence as a going concern, jobs and its
ability to provide competitive goods and services for customers.

Financial position and cash flows
Balance sheet
The Coop Group’s total assets increased by CHF 190 million year on year. On the assets side, where
there was a rise in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in receivables and inventories, current
assets climbed by CHF 458 million to CHF 6 887 million. Non-current assets decreased by CHF 268 mil-
lion to CHF 13 759 million. Planned and unplanned depreciation was higher than investments and addi-
tions originating from the acquisitions. Liabilities decreased by CHF 245 million year on year to CHF
10 066 million. Short-term liabilities declined by CHF 341 million to CHF 4 434 million, while long-term
liabilities increased by CHF 97 million to CHF 5 632 million. Within long-term liabilities, the Coop Group
financed itself through bonds and deposits. Equity including minority interests rose to CHF 10 579 mil-
lion. The equity ratio climbed to 51.2% as at 31 December 2020 and was therefore well above the stra-
tegic target of 40%.
Cash flow statement
The cash inflow from operating activities increased by CHF 550 million year on year to CHF 2 426 million.
The cash outflow from investing activities was CHF 98 million lower than in the previous year at CHF
1 293 million. This was due to both lower net investments in tangible fixed assets and reduced expend-
iture on acquisitions. A net amount of CHF 1 280 million was invested in tangible and intangible fixed
assets and a further CHF 4 million in acquisitions. In the case of financial assets/securities, a net
amount of CHF 8 million was invested. This resulted in free cash flow of CHF 1 146 million. The cash
outflow from financing activities amounted to CHF 180 million. The Coop Group Cooperative made a
bond repayment of CHF 300 million and issued a new bond in the amount of CHF 320 million. Short and
long-term financial liabilities together showed a decrease of CHF 84 million. Moreover, there was a CHF
2 million inflow of funds from the share of minority shareholders in a capital increase as well as a CHF
6 million outflow of funds owing to the increase in ownership interests in fully consolidated companies.
Dividends of CHF 111 million were paid to minority interests.

Prior-year figures restated
An increase or reduction in the ownership interest in fully consolidated organizations is regarded as a transaction with owners. The difference
between the transaction price and the corresponding minority interest is eliminated against equity and presented as capital reserves.

Notes to the annual consolidated financial statements
Consolidation and accounting principles
Basis of accounting
The annual consolidated financial statements are based on the annual financial statements of the
Group companies prepared as at 31 December 2020 in accordance with uniform policies and p              ­ resent a
true and fair view of the financial position, results of o    ­ perations and cash flows. The consolidated finan-
cial statements of the Coop Group comply with all Swiss GAAP ARR (Accounting and Reporting Recom-
mendations) and Swiss legal provisions.
Assets are measured at purchase or production cost. Liabilities are carried at their historical value. The
income statement is ­presented using the total cost (nature of expense) method. The valuation principles
were applied unchanged compared with the previous year.
The annual consolidated financial statements of the Coop Group are presented in Swiss francs (CHF).
Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are stated in millions of Swiss francs.
Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is prepared on the basis of the fund comprising cash and cash equivalents.
Cash flow from operating activities is calculated using the indirect method.
Scope of consolidation
The annual consolidated financial statements of the Coop Group comprise the Coop Group Cooperative
and its equity investments. The Coop Group Cooperative equity investments are listed in the notes un-
der Scope of consolidation (significant companies).
Fully consolidated organizations are organizations where the Coop Group directly or indirectly holds
more than 50% of the voting rights.
Associated organizations are entities over which the Coop Group is able to exercise significant influ-
ence. This is usually the case if it holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Equity investments where it holds less than 20% are not con­solidated and are presented in financial
assets at cost less any necessary write-downs.
Consolidation method
Fully consolidated organizations
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses are consolidated in full. Capital consolidation uses the pur-
chase method, whereby an ­organization’s equity at the date of acquisition or initial consolidation is
eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment at the parent. Newly acquired organizations
are revalued at their current value applying uniform Group policies and included in the annual consoli-
dated financial statements from the date on which control takes effect. If the cost of acquisition is
higher than the revalued net assets acquired, the remaining excess is recognized as goodwill and amor-
tized on a straight-line basis.
Purchase price adjustments contingent on future events are forecasted. If the final purchase price
­differs from the estimate, goodwill is adjusted accordingly.
 A negative goodwill (badwill) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. Organiza-
 tions sold are included up until the date on which ­control is lost, which is usually the date of sale. Minor-
 ity interests in consolidated equity and in profit or loss are presented separately in the balance sheet
 and income statement. An increase or reduction in the ownership interest in fully consolidated organi-
 zations is regarded as a trans­action with owners. Gains and losses on such transactions are therefore
 eliminated directly against equity.
 Intercompany transactions and relationships, i.e. income, expenses, receivables and liabilities between
 consolidated ­organizations, are offset and eliminated. If significant, intercompany profits on trans­
 actions within the Group are eliminated.
 Associated organizations
 If economically significant, associated organizations are includ­ed in the annual consolidated financial
 statements using the ­equity method. The financial statements of these organizations prepared in
 ­accordance with the true and fair view principle are used to determine the share of equity.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Currency conversion
Local assets and liabilities are converted into Swiss francs at the exchange rate at the balance sheet
date. The local income statements and the cash flow statements are converted at the average rate.
Currency effects arising on the translation into Swiss francs of the balance sheet and income statement
components of financial statements prepared in a foreign currency are recognized solely in equity.
When foreign subsidiaries or associated organizations are sold, the proportionate accumulated curren-
cy differences remain in equity and are not transferred to the income statement.

Net sales from goods and services
Net sales from goods and services result from the sale of goods and the provision of services in the
course of ordinary activities during the reporting period. Net sales from the sale of goods to customers
are generated in the supermarkets, the various specialist formats, the wholesale stores and the sup-
plies business or originate from goods produced at Coop’s own manufacturing companies. Net sales
from services originate from the provision of transport services, from hotel business and from fitness
centre membership subscriptions, for example. Sales are recognized at fair value. Sales and value-add-
ed taxes as well as sales reductions such as discounts, rebates and other allowances are deducted from
the net sales reported. Sales are recognized when the significant risks and rewards incidental to owner-
ship of the products sold as well as control have transferred to the customer and it is reasonably certain
that the resulting receivables will be collectible in cases where the transaction is not a cash sale. Net
sales from the provision of services are recognized in the accounting period in which the service was
rendered. In the event of agency transactions, only the value of the service rendered by the entity itself
is reported.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value. They comprise cash on
hand, postal and bank account balances, short-term deposits and cheques. These items are convertible
into cash at any time and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Securities
Securities are marketable instruments that can be easily real­ized. They are carried in the balance sheet
at market value. ­Unlisted securities are carried in the balance sheet at cost less any necessary write-
downs.
Receivables from goods and services and other short-term receivables
Receivables are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value. Valuation allowances for losses that are
identifiable and have occurred are deducted and charged to the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost comprises the net purchase price
and incidental charges. Purchased inventories are measured at the average cost price (moving average
price) and internally produced inventories at production cost. Inventories are stated at net realizable
value if this is lower than cost. Discounts are treated as reductions in the purchase price.
Specific valuation allowances are recognized for goods that are no longer serviceable or difficult to sell.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Financial assets
Financial assets include the associated organizations recognized using the equity method. Long-term
loans and securities held for the purpose of long-term investment are also presented as financial as-
sets. Securities and loans are stated at cost less any necessary write-downs.
Assets from employer contribution reserves are recognized as financial assets.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets, which also include properties not used for operating purposes, are stated at cost
less any necessary depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price plus the directly attributable costs
of bringing the assets to usable condition. Investments in existing tangible fixed assets are recognized
in the cost of an asset if they increase its value in use over the long term or extend its useful life. Depre-
ciation is applied on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset.
The depreciation period of tangible fixed assets is usually within the following ranges:
Land and buildings
Plots of land                                 no depreciation
Buildings                                             40–67
Installations                                         15–30
Furniture, machinery and IT
Furniture/tools                                        5–10
Sales outlet fittings/market fittings                10–15
Machinery                                              3–15
Production systems                                    20–30
IT                                                       3–8
Vehicles                                                3–10
The depreciation period for buildings ranges from 40 years in the case of properties used for operation-
al purposes and subject to increased use to 67 years in the case of mixed-used properties. Installations
are usually depreciated over a period of 15 to 20 years. At production facilities, specific production
installa­tions are depreciated over a longer useful life of up to 30 years.
Experience shows that fittings in the retail sales outlets have a shorter useful life than fittings in the
wholesale markets.
Machinery usually has a useful life of up to 15 years, with production systems possibly forming a sepa-
rate asset category and having a useful life of 20 to 30 years. Heavy commercial vehicles have a depre-
ciation period of up to ten years.
Assets under construction include the cumulative project costs eligible for capitalization. Project costs
that are not eligible for capitalization are charged to the income statement when incurred. Impairment
charges are recognized on assets under construction if there is evidence of impairment. In the event of
additions in the scope of consolidation, non-current assets are remeasured on the basis of the cumula-
tive cost of and accumulated depreciation or amortization charges on the acquired assets at the acqui-
sition date. Non-current assets are remeasured by adjusting the accumulated depreciation or amortiza-
tion so that the acquired assets are measured on a net basis at their actual value at the acquisition date.
They are presented gross in the statements of changes in fixed assets. In addition, the depreciation or
amortization period is reviewed, and if necessary adjusted, bearing in mind the remaining useful life.
Leases
Payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. Assets acquired on the basis of leases and for which the risks and ­rewards pass to the Coop
Group at inception of the lease are classified as finance leases. For the relevant assets, therefore, the
fair value or, if lower, the net present value of the future, non-cancellable lease payments is recognized
as an asset and as a finance lease liability. Assets under finance leases are a  ­ mortized over the shorter
of their estimated useful life and the lease term.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Intangible assets
This item includes IT software, trademarks, licences, patents and goodwill from acquisitions. Intangible
assets are recognized if they are clearly identifiable, the costs can be reliably determined and they yield
measurable economic benefits for the entity over several years. They are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful life.
Goodwill from acquisitions is calculated as the difference between the purchase price paid to acquire an
entity and the value of the net assets. The net assets correspond to the total of the individual assets of
the acquired entity less the liabilities and contingent liabilities under Swiss GAAP ARR at the acquisition
date. Any goodwill that arises is generally capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis. The amor-
tization period is determined based on the expected useful life of the assumed market and synergy
potential that gave rise to the goodwill. Goodwill that has been fully written down is derecognized in the
subsequent period.
The depreciation period of intangible assets is usually within the following ranges:
Goodwill                                           up to 20
Trademarks                                         up to 20
Patents/licences                                          5
Other intangible assets                                 3–8
Impairment
In the Coop Group, non-current assets are tested for impairment annually if there are indications of a
decline in value. The recoverable amount is calculated using the capital asset pricing model and taking
into account updated assumptions and expected cash flows from the multi-year plan. If the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount, it is a        ­ djusted in profit or loss by way of an impairment charge.
Liabilities
Short-term liabilities include all liabilities due within one year, accrued liabilities and deferred income,
and short-term ­provisions. Long-term liabilities comprise obligations with a ­maturity of more than
one year.
One of the ways in which Coop raises financing is the Depositenkasse, which provides investors with
interest-bearing deposit accounts. After the statutory six month blocking period on new deposits,
CHF 20 000 can be withdrawn from the available balance on the deposit account each month. Amounts
in excess of this limit require three months’ notice. The breakdown of deposit accounts into short and
long-term financial liabilities is based on empirical values for past outflows (substance over form).
Short-term and long-term liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their nominal amounts.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized if a past event gives rise to a probable legal or constructive obligation, the
amount and/or timing ­of which is uncertain, but can be estimated. Provisions are measured on the ­basis
of an estimate of the probable outflow. Provisions are discounted if the effect is material.
Income taxes
Current income taxes are recognized on an accrual basis based on the results of operations actually
generated and presented in the reporting period.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary taxable or tax-deductible differences between
the tax base and Swiss GAAP ARR carrying amounts using the balance sheet liability method. The de-
ferred income taxes to be recognized annually are calculated at the future tax rate applicable to the
taxable entity in question at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are not recognized for tax loss
carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if they relate to the same taxable entity and are
levied by the same t­ axation authority.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Derivative financial instruments
The Coop Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge currency risk. Both derivative financial
instruments for the purposes of hedging balance sheet items and those not held for hedging purposes
are recognized at current values. The change in the current values since the last measurement is recog-
nized in profit or loss for the period. Instruments used to hedge contractual future cash flows are not
recognized in the balance sheet, but disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments outstanding at the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes to the
annual consolidated financial statements.
Pension benefit obligations
Pension benefit obligations are all obligations arising from pension plans and pension institutions that
provide retirement, death and disability benefits.
Coop Group employees receive pension benefits, or old-age pensions, which are in line with the legal
regulations and provisions applicable in each of the countries. Pension plans and pension institutions
are usually funded from employer and employee contributions. The contributions made by Coop Group
companies are included in personnel expense under social security contributions.
In Switzerland, employees are members of a legally independent pension institution or a collective foun-
dation of banks or insurance companies. The terms provide for benefits that usually go well beyond the
statutory minimum under Swiss law. In addition, within the pension institution, most employees can
choose whether to join a plan with higher or lower savings contributions.
Annually, it is assessed whether a pension institution gives rise to an economic benefit or an economic
obligation from the organization’s perspective.
The pension institutions’ annual financial statements prepared in accordance with Swiss GAAP FER 26
and giving a true and fair view of the existing surplus or deficit are taken as the basis for the assess-
ment.
An economic benefit is only recognized if it is permitted and intended to use the surplus to reduce em-
ployer contributions. Any freely available employer contribution reserves are recognized as assets. An
economic obligation is recognized if the requirements for recognizing a provision are met.
The Group companies abroad do not have legally independent pension institutions with separated as-
sets. Here, obligations arising from pension plans are recognized directly in the balance sheet.
Related party transactions
Associated organizations, pension funds and natural persons such as members of the Executive Com-
mittee or Board of Directors are considered to be related parties.
Significant financial statement items with associated organizations and other related party transac-
tions are disclosed in the notes to the annual consolidated f­ inancial statements.
Off-balance sheet transactions
Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, guarantee obligations, pledges and other obligations not re-
quired to be recognized in the balance sheet are measured at each balance sheet date and disclosed at
nominal value. Other obligations not required to be recognized in the balance sheet include all long-term
obligations entered into which cannot be terminated within one year. If contingent liabilities and other
obligations not required to be recognized in the balance sheet lead to an outflow of funds ­without any
usable inflow of funds and this outflow of funds is probable and can be estimated, a provision is recog-
nized.
Change in accounting policies
Differences arising on the translation of financial statements into the Group currency are recognized
directly in equity. Under the consolidation and accounting principles applicable thus far, accumulated
currency differences were transferred from equity to the income statement when subsidiaries or asso-
ciated organizations were sold. Accumulated translation differences are no longer transferred to the
income statement, as this is preferable from an accrual basis perspective. The 2019 reporting period is
unaffected by this change and so prior-year figures were not restated.

Coop Group Annual Report 2020
Restatement of prior-year figures
Provisions for loyalty bonuses and early retirement arrangements are calculated on the basis of a new
model. The consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and table 18
in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements were therefore restated accordingly for the
2019 period. For reasons of immateriality, the 2019 income statement was not restated.
Goodwill that has been fully written down is now derecognized in the subsequent period. Table 15 in the
notes to the annual consolidated financial statements was therefore restated accordingly for the 2019
period.

“Wholesale/Production” comprises the Transgourmet Group, the Bell Food Group and the manufacturing companies of the Coop Cooperative. The
Consolidation line contains deliveries between the segments.
Contrary to the complementary recommendation for listed companies (Swiss GAAP FER 31), the Coop Group will not publish segment results until
further notice, as these may contain significant distortions owing to Covid-19, which could result in a competitive disadvantage in respect of com-
petitors and economic disadvantages triggered by customers and suppliers.

Expected income taxes are calculated based on the assumption that the non-operating result will be taxed the same as the ordinary result. The
other effects in 2020 are mostly the result of changes in tax rates for deferred taxes. The additional effects are due mainly to non-taxable income
and expenses and prior-period income taxes.

Obligations to minority interest shareholders from put options on the shares they hold in consolidated Group organizations are presented in “Other
non-recognizable commitments”. The same applies to obligations with regard to the acquisition of shares in associated organizations. There are
additional contingent liabilities under existing contracts which cannot be estimated reliably due to the low probability of occurrence and the lack of
clarity regarding the amount of a potential outflow of funds. These relate mostly to leased properties.

                  as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements
                  that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
                  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
                  ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
                  going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease
                  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
                  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
                  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
                  whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
                  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
                  conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement
                  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
                  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
                  these consolidated financial statements.
                  As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional
                  judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
                  —     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
                        to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
                        that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
                        misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
                        forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
                  —     Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
                        appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
                        Group’s internal control.
                  —     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
                        and related disclosures made.
                  —     Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
                        based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
                        that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
                        material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures
                        in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
                        conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future
                        events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
                  —     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
                        the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
                        events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
                  —     Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
                        activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
                        responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible
                        for our audit opinion.
                  We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the
                  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
                  internal control that we identify during our audit.
                  We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with
                  relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other
                  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to
                  eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
                                                                                                                                          4

                  From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those
                  matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period
                  and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or
                  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine
                  that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
                  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
                  Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
                  In accordance with article 906 CO in connection with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing
                  Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of
                  consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
                  We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.
