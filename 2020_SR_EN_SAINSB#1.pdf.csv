Net Zero
by 2040
We have committed to investing £1 billion over twenty years towards
becoming a Net Zero business across our own operations by 2040,
aligned to the highest ambitions of the Paris Climate Change
Agreement. We are implementing a programme of change, focusing
on reducing carbon emissions, food waste, plastic packaging and
water usage and increasing recycling, biodiversity and healthy and
sustainable eating.
To support our commitment and to drive long-lasting and meaningful change, we will be supporting the UN Climate
Change Conference, COP26, as Principal Supermarket Sponsor in the upcoming year and signed up to the UN’s Race to
Zero campaign, designed to accelerate the adoption of net zero targets ahead of COP26. We have also set remuneration
targets for the Board against our key Net Zero by 2040 pillars to help drive business performance. More information on
remuneration targets can be found in our Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021.

Water
Water is the most precious natural resource on the planet. But, as populations increase, there’s
less of it to go around. We’re doing our bit to tackle water scarcity by improving the efficiency of
our water use across our operations, and are working with experts to implement water-saving
initiatives. Through robust water stewardship, we are addressing and managing all areas of water
vulnerability in our business as we aim for water neutrality by 2040.

to reduce or put as much of our waste as possible to good use. This includes working with farmers

use including to our charity food donation partners and recovering energy from our waste.

Plastics and recycling
Packaging helps us deliver fresh, undamaged produce, but we know that it can have a negative
impact on our planet, therefore reducing plastic across all our stores and supply chain is one
of our absolute priorities. This is why we were the UK’s first major retailer to make a significant
commitment to reduce plastic, pledging to cut plastic packaging by 50 per cent by 2025.

Sustainable
Sourcing
We source products from over 60 countries and have a vital role to
play in supporting our farmers, growers and suppliers across the
world. We work collaboratively to tackle climate change, reduce
our environmental impact and improve the livelihoods of farmers,
growers and suppliers. Whether it’s our people, animals or the
environment, we aim to have equivalent standards wherever we
source from in the world.

¹ The Net Zero Steerco was established in February 2020 to support delivery of our Net Zero by 2040 plan. This forum initially existed
alongside our Value Management Groups which governed our 2020 Sustainability Plan. These forums were phased out over the past
year on completion of this plan, and our social agenda has been governed via Director forums and the Operating Board. To ensure
effective governance across our ESG agenda, we have refreshed our CR&S governance structure which we intend to implement in the
upcoming year.

Carbon Commentary
       We started the 2020/21 financial year ahead of our target trajectory which supported us to achieve our target. Store closures as a result of COVID-19 also contributed to the carbon savings
       across the year as did our continued focus on LED light installation, with a total of 472 supermarkets with LED lights installed by the end of the 2020/21 financial year.
       The future programme continues to be well planned and focuses on efficiency improvements. The 2021/22 financial year will see the LED programme completed across the estate.

              Commentary
 Food Waste   This year we reduced the food waste we send to anaerobic digestion in our own operations by over 5,000 tonnes, a reduction of 16 per cent year-on year, which puts us ahead of our
              target trajectory. This has been driven by reductions in our overall operational waste figure, owing to propositional changes in our food service departments, as well as growth in the
              volume redistributed to both humans and animals as a result of impacts from the pandemic and process improvement. See page 10 for breakdown of redistribution to humans and
              animals.
              Our ability to meet our target is dependent upon increasing the amount we redistribute for human consumption and we are looking into third party tech solutions to enable this.

 Plastic  Commentary
          In 2020, our efforts to reduce packaging were hampered by COVID-19 due to increased sales volumes and having to use plastic for some high volume lines, e.g. for eggs, as pulp packaging
          supply ran out across the industry. However if we strip out the impact of COVID-19 we are still behind our trajectory so significant progress is required in order for us to meet our long term
          target.

             Commentary
             % timber sourced to an independent sustainability standard
             Last year we reported on Sainsbury’s only. This is the first year that we have reported on Argos and Habitat which will be a focus going forward.
             % palm sourced to an independent sustainability standard
             Our sustainable sourcing performance on palm oil remains strong and we continue to strive towards our 100 per cent target.
             % soy sourced to an independent sustainability standard
             This year saw a significant improvement in the share of soy feed sourced sustainably in our supply chains as we continue engaging with our suppliers.
Biodiversity % cotton sourced to an independent sustainability standard
             Improvements this year are attributed to a greater sourcing of sustainable cotton within General Merchandise and Clothing.
             % wild caught seafood sales which is independently certified as sustainable
             The fall this year can be attributed to mackerel loosing its Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification which creates challenges for meeting our long term target.
             % farmed seafood sales which is independently certified as sustainable
             Our farmed seafood remains 100 per cent sustainably certified and we expect to be the first retailer to transition to Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) in the UK.
             Number of Woodland Trust trees planted
             Last year we focused on planting trees in strategic areas (schools and communities) as oppose to chasing the highest number.
