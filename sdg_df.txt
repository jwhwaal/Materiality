How we performed
In 2020, the number of injuries that resulted in lost days decreased by 6% to 2.0 injuries per 100 full-
time equivalents. While COVID-19 put additional pressure on our brands, associate health and safety
remained a top priority and we were able to decrease both the rate of lost days due to accidents and
the occupational illness frequency rate.
The safety metric was positively impacted by increased working hours as well as additional measures
put in place to help front-line associates stay healthy. The retail locations reduced the rate of lost work
days due to a strong safety focus and operational changes through the year, including reduced
operating hours (based on local mandates) and temporary closure of some store production
departments. Increased activity and product volume in distribution centers resulted in increased injuries
in some facilities. COVID-19 cases are not included in the reported data and, therefore, did not impact
performance on these metrics.
Our brands continue to prioritize integrating everyday health and safety measures into the workplace.
For example, at Delhaize Belgium, a performance management dashboard has enabled the brand to
take a proactive rather than reactive approach to associate safety.
Occupational illness frequency rate decreased significantly by 0.13 points to 0.04 illnesses per one
million hours worked. The basis for the decline in occupational illnesses is consistent with more
personal protective equipment usage. Many occupational illness exposures can be reduced with the
use of personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves.

Our brands’ safety programs address regulations and initiatives that contribute to physical safety
and mental health at work. In stores, offices and distribution centers, safe working practices are
integrated right into designs, equipment purchases and operational practices. Safety is improved
not only through visible leadership, but by engaging associates to play their own role, keeping an
eye out for potentially dangerous or inappropriate situations.
Our initiatives are aligned with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, protecting labor rights and
promoting safe and secure working environments for all.
Our focus
With our work safety strategy and roadmap, we aim to create a safety mindset throughout the
brands. Cross-functional safety committees in all brands will drive visibility, awareness and trainings,
and promote safe methods of working. Our ambition for 2020 is to reduce our Workplace Injury

 How our Community Champions help
 From outreach programmes to grant giving, our Community Champions
 listen to our communities’ needs and work with local people to make sure
 we’re providing support to those who need it most. They work tirelessly to
 support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real impact for local
 people. They also build close relationships with local schools, working with
 teachers to promote healthy food and an active lifestyle, enthusing children
 about cooking and talking to them about protecting the environment. In
 2019, our Community Champions worked with over 15,000 local groups
 across the UK, and reached 2,791 schools.1
 Every year, Asda Community Champions…
 •       Provide space in our stores to local groups to raise awareness of
         services available within the community, collect food for food banks
         and support fundraising for local charities. Some of our stores also
         have rooms available free of charge that community groups can use to
         hold meetings.
 •       Run fundraising events in our stores, through bag packing, bucket
         collections and by donating goods to fundraising events. Our
         Community Champions have also taken part in some remarkable
         colleague fundraising events – from shaving their hair off to running
         marathons. In everything they do, they make us all incredibly proud.
 •       Each Champion also has a monthly budget for monetary and product
         donations to provide practical support to local charities. They also
         coordinate the in-store Green Token Giving scheme, funded by the
         Asda Foundation.

cial statements of the Coop Group comply with all Swiss GAAP ARR (Accounting and Reporting Recom-
mendations) and Swiss legal provisions.
Assets are measured at purchase or production cost. Liabilities are carried at their historical value. The
income statement is ­presented using the total cost (nature of expense) method. The valuation principles
were applied unchanged compared with the previous year.
The annual consolidated financial statements of the Coop Group are presented in Swiss francs (CHF).
Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are stated in millions of Swiss francs.
Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is prepared on the basis of the fund comprising cash and cash equivalents.
Cash flow from operating activities is calculated using the indirect method.
Scope of consolidation
The annual consolidated financial statements of the Coop Group comprise the Coop Group Cooperative
and its equity investments. The Coop Group Cooperative equity investments are listed in the notes un-
der Scope of consolidation (significant companies).
Fully consolidated organizations are organizations where the Coop Group directly or indirectly holds
more than 50% of the voting rights.
Associated organizations are entities over which the Coop Group is able to exercise significant influ-
ence. This is usually the case if it holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Equity investments where it holds less than 20% are not con­solidated and are presented in financial
assets at cost less any necessary write-downs.
Consolidation method
Fully consolidated organizations
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses are consolidated in full. Capital consolidation uses the pur-
chase method, whereby an ­organization’s equity at the date of acquisition or initial consolidation is
eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment at the parent. Newly acquired organizations
are revalued at their current value applying uniform Group policies and included in the annual consoli-
dated financial statements from the date on which control takes effect. If the cost of acquisition is
higher than the revalued net assets acquired, the remaining excess is recognized as goodwill and amor-
tized on a straight-line basis.
Purchase price adjustments contingent on future events are forecasted. If the final purchase price
­differs from the estimate, goodwill is adjusted accordingly.
 A negative goodwill (badwill) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. Organiza-
 tions sold are included up until the date on which ­control is lost, which is usually the date of sale. Minor-
 ity interests in consolidated equity and in profit or loss are presented separately in the balance sheet
 and income statement. An increase or reduction in the ownership interest in fully consolidated organi-
 zations is regarded as a trans­action with owners. Gains and losses on such transactions are therefore
 eliminated directly against equity.
 Intercompany transactions and relationships, i.e. income, expenses, receivables and liabilities between
 consolidated ­organizations, are offset and eliminated. If significant, intercompany profits on trans­
 actions within the Group are eliminated.
 Associated organizations
 If economically significant, associated organizations are includ­ed in the annual consolidated financial
 statements using the ­equity method. The financial statements of these organizations prepared in
 ­accordance with the",2020,"SR","EN","COOPCH##","TRUE"

ment.
An economic benefit is only recognized if it is permitted and intended to use the surplus to reduce em-
ployer contributions. Any freely available employer contribution reserves are recognized as assets. An
economic obligation is recognized if the requirements for recognizing a provision are met.
The Group companies abroad do not have legally independent pension institutions with separated as-
sets. Here, obligations arising from pension plans are recognized directly in the balance sheet.
Related party transactions
Associated organizations, pension funds and natural persons such as members of the Executive Com-
mittee or Board of Directors are considered to be related parties.
Significant financial statement items with associated organizations and other related party transac-
tions are disclosed in the notes to the annual consolidated f­ inancial statements.
Off-balance sheet transactions
Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, guarantee obligations, pledges and other obligations not re-
quired to be recognized in the balance sheet are measured at each balance sheet date and disclosed at
nominal value. Other obligations not required to be recognized in the balance sheet include all long-term
obligations entered into which cannot be terminated within one year. If contingent liabilities and other
obligations not required to be recognized in the balance sheet lead to an outflow of funds ­without any
usable inflow of funds and this outflow of funds is probable and can be estimated, a provision is recog-
nized.
Change in accounting policies
Differences arising on the translation of financial statements into the Group currency are recognized
directly in equity. Under the consolidation and accounting principles applicable thus far, accumulated
currency differences were transferred from equity to the income statement when subsidiaries or asso-
ciated organizations were sold. Accumulated translation differences are no longer transferred to the
income statement, as this is preferable from an accrual basis perspective. The 2019 reporting period is
unaffected by this change and so prior-year figures were not restated.",2020,"SR","EN","COOPCH##","TRUE"

                  We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under
                  those provisions and standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the
                  Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the
                  provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical
                  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
                  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
                  opinion.

                  as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements
                  that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
                  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s
                  ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
                  going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease
                  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
                  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
                  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
                  whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
                  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
                  conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement
                  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
                  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
                  these consolidated financial statements.
                  As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional
                  judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
                  —     Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
                        to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
                        that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
                        misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
                        forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
                  —     Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
                        appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
                        Group’s internal control.
                  —     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
                        and related disclosures made.
                  —     Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
                        based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
                        that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
                        material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures
                        in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
                        conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future
                        events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
                  —     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
                        the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
                        events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
                  —     Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
                        activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
                        responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible
                        for our audit opinion.
                  We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the
                  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
                  internal control that we identify during our audit.
                  We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with
