A strategy more relevant
              than ever before
ICA Gruppen’s strategy is aimed at ensuring long-term growth with sustained profitability
   – in a market in major transition. The pace of change has been fast for many years,
  but increased further over the past year as a result of Covid-19. Overall, developments
 have shown that ICA Gruppen’s strategy – with its strong focus on digitalisation, online,
      health and value for money, among other things – is more relevant than ever.

 From trends to the new normal
  The pace of change in all of ICA Gruppen’s markets is high. New technology, rapid digitalisation, new consumption
  patterns and extensive blurring of industry lines are fundamentally changing the markets. These trends have been
  around for several years, but some have been very noticeably reinforced by Covid-19. Among other things, the
  pandemic has contributed to a marked increase in online shopping and even greater interest in health and well­
  being. It is also expected to bring price and value for money more sharply into focus as time goes on.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  Impact on grocery retail

Risks and risk management
Risks and risk taking are a natural part of ICA Gruppen’s operations. A good understanding of the risks and
continuous monitoring of changes in the risk profile provide good conditions for risk to be considered in a relevant
way in decision-making, increasing the ability to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. An important aspect of
corporate governance therefore involves continuous analysis of risks as well as appropriate and effective manage-
ment of the risks that may have a significant negative impact on ICA Gruppen’s achievement of its objectives.

   
                Logistik AB is a company owned 50% by Alecta and 50% by ICA Gruppen. Långeberga
   Logistik AB owns ICA Gruppen’s warehouse property in Helsingborg. Based on the fact that ICA
   Gruppen uses the property for its own operations and that through the rent payments for the prop-
   erty, ICA Gruppen is responsible for the cash flows that Långeberga Logistik AB needs in order to
   meet its commitments, ICA Gruppen has control over the company. Långeberga Logistik AB is thus a
   subsidiary within ICA Gruppen.

ICA Gruppen reached its climate neutrality target in 2020. Since the base year 2006, emissions of g                                                         ­ reenhouse

of energy, refrigerants, logistics flows and goods transport. Altogether, emissions have decreased from an
average of 111 kg CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents) per square metre to 26 kg CO2e per square metre.

Rimi Baltic has its own lorries and also leases lorries. In Sweden both renewable fuels
and diesel are used. In the Baltic countries only diesel is used for the majority of the
year, but as of 2018 renewable fuels are also used in the summer months. Business
travel by air decreased significantly during the year, due to the ongoing pandemic,
which also resulted in lower emissions from business travel.

  ICA Gruppen works in a structured way, using tools and standards to follow up and ensure that the products sold and
  handled by the Group meet both internal and external requirements. One element of this is certification of large
  parts of the sourcing, logistics and store processes to relevant standards for quality and the environment.

Accounting principles
ICA Gruppen has drawn up its own accounting principles, which are detailed below. The accounting principles are partly based on the GRI framework, but have
been adapted for the Group’s operations based on the materiality analysis. The Sustainability Report mainly covers operations that have a significant, direct impact
from a sustainability perspective, i.e. ICA Gruppen’s own operations. The Report covers all companies within ICA Gruppen. There are certain exceptions, however,
which are detailed below. A Group-wide IT system is used to collect sustainability data. The system supports continuous reporting with the aim of ensuring the
long-term quality of the indicators included in ICA Gruppen’s continuous monitoring and reporting of sustainability work. Each company reports data according to
the Group’s definitions and procedures for sustainability reporting. The accounting principles are explained in detail below.
