Message from our CEO
For decades, supermarkets have been part of the fabric of daily life, fulfilling
the most basic needs of consumers – to feed their families. At Asda, we have
always been proud to be more than just a retailer and to play an active role in
the communities we serve, but 2020 and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic
brought that role into the spotlight more than ever before.
Alongside other essential workers, we’ve been at the frontline of feeding
the nation, operating our stores and home delivery services in the most
challenging of circumstances. Throughout this time, our first priority has
been keeping our customers and colleagues safe. We’ve enabled vulnerable
colleagues to stay at home on full pay while recruiting 23,000 temporary
team members, supporting local economies.
And we’ve worked shoulder to shoulder with
our suppliers to give them the certainty they’ve
needed – with clear communication and faster

redistributed to those in need.
While this year has been exceptional, I am
proud that we have not lost sight of our wider
environmental, social and governance (ESG)
responsibilities – because, even with a thousand plates spinning, doing the
right thing is baked into who we are. Through this report, we will share with
you how we’re progressing on the key ESG issues that matter to our business
and to you, our stakeholders, and where we stand to make the
greatest difference.
Despite the significant challenges of this last year, we have never lost sight
of the other great challenges our society faces. Climate change represents a
threat to human safety on an unparalleled scale and presents very material
risks to our food chain; we are committed to playing our part in accelerating
solutions which protect and regenerate our environment. Public health has
never been more under scrutiny than this year, or the inequalities affecting
health outcomes starker. Access to an affordable healthy diet is a fundamental
requirement and we take our opportunity to contribute here seriously. Social
inequality has never been greater – and we are determined to continue to
drive positive change, both within our organisation and externally.

Our Story
From the very beginning, Asda has championed customer value by listening
to our customers and communities, and developing products and services
that meet their needs. Our people and unique culture have always made Asda
a special place to work and shop. We take pride in our communities and do
everything we can to help the vulnerable, while working to help uncover and
tackle the root causes of hardship in society.
                                              The first Queens Supermarket, opened in Castleford by our founders Peter and Fred Asquith in 1962
Our company was founded in Yorkshire in the 1960s, where we still have our
home office today. Over the years, we’ve seen some momentous changes,
from opening the UK’s first self-service supermarket in Yorkshire in 1963 to our
acquisition by Walmart in 1999, making us part of the world’s biggest retailer, and
many other adventures along the way.
In 2009 we purchased International Procurement Limited (IPL), now one of
the UK’s biggest importers of produce to help improve the value, quality and
availability of our products in a cost-effective way, so we can continue to offer
low prices to our customers.
In 2021 we are at the beginning of the next exciting stage of our journey, having
recently left the Walmart family and gained new owners in TDR Capital and the
Issa brothers, founders and co-CEOs of EG Group.                                                                                                                                                                   In 2020, we brought back our iconic ‘Pocket Tap’ which is synonomous with great value.
Asda was part of the Walmart group until 16 February 2021, when it was sold to its new owners – TDR Capital and the Issa brothers. Asda will continue to use the George brand in the UK and certain other territories under licence from Walmart.

 Trends driving our approach
 We’re operating in a rapidly changing market influenced by
 major global challenges and consumer preferences.
 In particular, we and our partners are innovating to transform
 the way food is produced and consumed.
 The climate emergency
 In 2018, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
 (IPCC) called for urgent action to keep average global
 temperature rises below 1.5 degrees (compared to pre-industrial
 times). With the global food industry accounting for 25% of the
 world’s emissions (from production to sale), retailers must help
 to transform food production and build farmers’ resilience to
 climate change.
 Biodiversity collapse
 Biodiversity is vital to producing food crops. Yet nearly 70%
 of all wildlife has been lost since 1970 due to human activity,
 according to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF).1 This
 includes industrial farming, with large areas deforested in recent
 decades to grow crops. Deforestation and biodiversity loss
 also lead to climate change, so it’s critical that we protect and
 restore nature.
 Circular economy
 With deepening resource scarcity
 and concerns that food production is
 exceeding the planet’s natural limits,
 our industry must champion a more

 Transparency and human rights
 With growing stakeholder interest in radical transparency, it’s
 vital that our industry does more to address human right issues,
 including modern slavery, within our global supply networks.

Sustainability at George
As Britain’s first supermarket clothing brand, George now also includes
home products and is sold in over 560 Asda stores and through
George.com. George have the largest value and volume in Schoolwear1
and one in three buyers shops for Schoolwear at George.
But style, quality and price are not enough without making sure we’re
doing the right thing as a business. We believe we can use George’s
scale as a force for good and that good value, planet-friendly fashion
should not cost the earth or come at an unacceptable cost to workers.
So we are committed to reducing George’s environmental impact
and protecting the rights of the people who work hard to make our
products a success.
Building on strong foundations
Building on years of working to protect workers’ rights (see page 100),
George has extended its sustainability efforts to include environmental
issues. Collaboration sits at the heart of the way George tackles these
industry-wide challenges. For example, it works with the Ethical
Trading Initiative to improve labour conditions, and it’s supporting the
ZDHC Foundation to eliminate harmful chemicals in the global
fashion industry.
In March 2019, George took its ambitions to the next level with its
George for Good strategy, including a set of 2025 goals. These goals
focus on the five areas where the George business stands to make
the biggest difference. These are: responsibly
sourced raw materials, chemical management,
packaging, human rights and circular economy
innovation (keeping clothing in use for as long as
possible and transforming old clothes into raw

George works closely with Asda to address
these challenges, and during 2020 merged to

goals while supporting Asda’s broader push for

stronger and will build momentum more rapidly
on our shared vision for change.

Our ambition and strategy
A warming world and depletion of natural resources will have a direct
impact on UK food supply – and on our ability as a retailer to source it.
At the same time, more and more of us want to know where our food has
come from, and we want peace of mind in what we’re consuming. The
food retail sector is seeing unprecedented media and consumer interest in
environmental issues from plastics and palm oil, to food waste and
fish farming.
But tackling these issues is not always as straight forward as you may
think. For instance, plastic packaging, which is harmful to the environment,
extends shelf life thus avoiding food waste and associated carbon and
methane emissions. Navigating these kinds of dilemmas is a responsibility
we take very seriously and it’s why we work collectively, alongside other
supermarkets and with NGOs – so that solutions work for our planet
and communities.
Our Better Planet mission is to:
“BE TRUSTED TO CREATE CHANGE
FOR BETTER, TAKING REAL ACTION
TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE,
ELIMINATE WASTE AND PROTECT
NATURE’S RESOURCES.”
Some 65% of Asda shoppers say they’d be willing to change the way they
shop to be more environmentally friendly, but only 23% are acting on their
intentions – and price is one of the main reasons.1 At Asda, we believe that
shopping sustainably shouldn’t have to be a luxury. It is why our ‘Greener
at Asda Price’ promise pledges more sustainable choices at the same price,
or less, than standard alternatives. We’ll work with our colleagues and
suppliers to make this a reality, and continue to encourage and support our
customers in making behaviour changes that respect the planet.
Whether it’s food miles or animal welfare, soy or packaging – we have a
solid track record of acting decisively on environmental challenges. But we
know there is more to do. Our new ambitions will help to future-proof our
business and deliver value to our customers.

Fuel, fleet and refrigerants (Scope 1 emissions)
•    COMMITMENT 1: 50% lower direct GHG emissions
     (scope 1 & 2) by 2025 vs 2015 baseline
Scope 1 emissions have reduced by 5% when compared to 2018.
This has been driven by reductions in direct fuel combustion and
of refrigerant gas top-ups. Our logistics and transport fleet is the
second biggest contributor to our carbon footprint, representing
more than two thirds of our Scope 1 emissions. Our fleet is primarily
made up of our Asda Logistics Services (ALS) fleet of Heavy Goods
Vehicles (HGVs) and the online fleet of large vans. Consolidating
journeys in this way lowers mileage, costs and emissions.
After a successful pilot, we have started rolling out natural gas-
powered trucks; with over 300 already operational and another 200
due for delivery in the next year, making Asda’s the biggest UK fleet
of gas-run HGVs. Our ambition is to have a fully gas-run HGV fleet

carbon emissions by an estimated 71,000 tonnes. Electric vehicles

Electricity (Scope 2 emissions)
•    COMMITMENT 1: 50% lower direct GHG emissions (scope 1 & 2) by
     2025 vs 2015 baseline
Our energy strategy focuses on three core areas:
•    Reduce energy intensity: Lower energy consumption and decrease the cost to sell
•    Buy renewables: Lessen impact of rising costs and reduce our reliance on
     fossil fuels
•    Control the most efficient stores: Control energy efficiency and carbon reduction.
Our energy governance group meets regularly to drive momentum against our
strategy and targets. For example, the group has agreed a plan to identify the best and
most cost-effective ways to purchase electricity, including through Power Purchase
Agreements and potential on-site generation activities (such as solar PV panels).
Although we’ve expanded our store space by 200% over the past decades, we’ve
reduced the amount of electricity we use by over 20%. We were the first UK
supermarket to create a virtual 20MW power station, reducing demand on the National
Grid. We’re also monitoring building performance 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Scope 2 emissions have reduced by 14% to 298,538 tCO₂e in 2019. In absolute
consumption terms, electricity usage has decreased from 1,230GWh to 1,160GWh. This
is a result of successfully implementing energy efficiency projects and the continued
decarbonisation of the UK grid. To drive progress on Scope 2 emissions we will
purchase or source 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025.
Value chain (Scope 3 emissions)
•    COMMITMENT 2: Develop measurement of non-direct scope 3 emissions,
     then set targets to 2025
For any retailer, Scope 3 emissions created indirectly via customers or suppliers are the
most complex to measure and reduce – but they can be significant. As both purchaser
and retailer, Asda has a responsibility to support emissions reductions right across our
value chain. In doing so, we engage stakeholders and address climate change more
holistically and transparently.
We have committed to establish a measurement methodology, publish our footprint,
and release reduction targets before 2025 for our Scope 3 emissions. Scope 3
emissions include all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain
that are not in Scope 1 and 2.
We are currently working with key suppliers to help map a more complete view of our
Scope 3 emissions. We recently held our biggest ever Sustainability Conference, which
brought together over 1,300 supplier representatives and Asda colleagues to share
ideas and solutions to tackling issues across our whole sustainability scope.

We’re promoting more responsible farming practices in our supply
chain by encouraging farmers to adopt a precise approach to applying
pesticides and fertilisers and follow the principles of Integrated Pest
Management (IPM). This is a holistic way of controlling pests using a
variety of methods, while lowering any unintended impacts on other
insects, animals and plants. Additionally, we are trialling planting cover

Soy
Soy (or soya) has become an important source of nutritious
protein. We mainly consume it via meat products (it is a
common feed in mass livestock production). But it’s also
increasingly part of plant-based diets and is used in
cooking oil, biofuel and cosmetics. With global
demand for meat still increasing, soy production
has risen significantly, increasing pressure                                                                   Soy Certified    Soy Certified

Timber, paper and pulp
As global timber requirements rise, we are increasing our use of responsible
forestry products which can help protect natural forests and support
sustainable livelihoods.
We committed to ensuring that all of the wood, paper or pulp contained in
our own-brand products would be sourced sustainably by the end of 2020.
That means, the material for products such as cards, tissues and toilet roll is
sourced through the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Programme for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) schemes. By the end of 2020 we’d
achieved 98.6%1 with a clear plan of action for the remaining product.
Away from product we have also taken important steps in areas such as till
receipts which are now FSC certified. Additionally, it is now policy that all our
card packaging within our Extra Special range is sustainably sourced.
Cocoa
We all know and love the humble cocoa bean. However, its production is often
linked to deforestation and child labour. We have committed to using 100%
sustainably sourced cocoa by the end of 2020 and will update you in our next
report when we have all the necessary data.
We ask all suppliers of Asda Brand products containing cocoa to comply
with our sustainable cocoa policy. Through these schemes, such as Rainforest
Alliance Certified, cocoa farmers adopt practices that help to protect the
environment and benefit farm workers and their communities.
To help customers identify sustainably sourced cocoa, products containing
more than 12% cocoa must display the mark of the relevant certifying scheme
on the packaging.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Cocoa, Coffee & Tea
Coffee and tea
Coffee is one of the most popular drinks consumed worldwide. However, as
farmers’ coffee yields become affected by extreme weather and plant diseases,
the risk of further deforestation increases. To source coffee sustainably, we
are supporting Asda own-brand product suppliers and growers to improve
practices in a way that helps protect the environment and improves their
livelihoods, providing responsibly sourced coffee products by the end of 2021.
Asda-approved coffee sourcing schemes are: Rainforest Alliance Certified2 and
Colombian Coffee Growers Federation (FNC).3
We are currently developing our Tea Policy. To ensure our tea is sustainably
sourced the majority of it is Rainforest Alliance Certified and by the end of
2021 all our black tea will be covered by this scheme.

Sustainable seafood
Over 80% of the world’s fish stocks are fully exploited or
overexploited1, highlighting the importance of sourcing from
well-managed fisheries that conserve ocean biodiversity.
We know our customers are interested in where their fish
comes from, and it’s our job to show sourcing information
clearly on seafood products so customers can make their
own informed choices. That’s why we are working with the
Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) to support responsible
fishing across our industry and better understand the risks in
our supply chain. Its Ocean Disclosure Project report includes
social and environmental information on our white fish (cod and
haddock) supply, an industry first. We also support fisheries in
Fisheries Improvement Projects to improve their practices.
Tuna
Our own-brand tinned tuna is sourced from fisheries using
pole and line or using Fish Aggregating Devices, as part of the
Fisheries Improvement Projects. Asda has been a member of
the Global Tuna Alliance since 2019.2 working to improve the
management of tuna stocks. We also support the creation of
marine reserves and marine protected areas.
Fish meals and oils in our supply chain
While limited quantities of fish meals and oils are used
for terrestrial livestock, larger volumes are used in aquaculture
diets. Asda has supported the Fisheries Improvement
Project for South East Asian fisheries, which is raising

Thailand.                                                                                                   WE KNOW OUR CUSTOMERS ARE

 Animal welfare
 We’re making improvements across our supply chain to
 make sure that all animals are treated with dignity and
 respect. In particular, we’re working closely with farmers
 to develop better ways of rearing animals. For example,
 we have formed farmer groups to benchmark health
 and welfare standards. We also use the ‘Five Freedoms’
 framework1 to help define our animal welfare and
 sourcing policies.
 At Asda, we stipulate that all of our meat must be stunned
 pre-slaughter. For more information about our position on
 animal welfare, have a look at our Animal Welfare Policy.2
 We are also committed to sourcing cage-free shell eggs

 We do not support the routine preventative use of
 antibiotics in livestock rearing. We work with suppliers and
 farmers on the reduction and responsible use of antibiotics
 without compromising animal welfare. We are also members
 of the Food Industry Initiative on Antimicrobials, and the
 Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance,
 working across the food sector on this important topic.4

     Waste                    nothing goes in the bin
We hate waste of any kind – from food, packaging
and product, to wasted energy, road miles and
natural resources. Our mission is to eliminate
all avoidable waste, ensuring that whatever is
unavoidable can be reused or recycled. The amount
of natural resources and carbon emissions associated
with the production, transit and sale of food or
packaging which ends up in the bin (where it then
produces further emissions, causes damage to
wildlife or litters our countryside and oceans) drives
our focus on this. Our ambitious waste commitments
help us to support a more sustainable future, while
reducing costs and increasing efficiency.
        At Asda, we create three main waste streams and we have made specific commitments across each one
      •   COMMITMENT 5: Operational waste               • COMMITMENT 6: Food waste                     • COMMITMENT 7:

Operational waste
Operational waste, which we handle in our stores, depots
and offices, comes from a range of areas, including
packaging from the supply chain, product damages and
returns, pharmaceutical and hazardous materials, as well
as customer waste from car parks, recycling bins
and cafe’s.
•    COMMITMENT 5: Zero waste operations
     by 2025
Our zero waste policy guides our efforts to reduce, reuse,
recycle and redistribute our operational waste, and since
2019 we have diverted zero operational waste direct
to landfill.
The largest type of waste we handle at our sites comes
from the secondary or transit packaging on the goods
we sell. All our cardboard and plastic film is sorted at the
back of each store and returned on segregated cages to
one of our nine Asda Service Centres which are spread
around the UK. There, materials are further separated and
baled ready for recycling by our waste service providers.
The cardboard is most likely to return to Asda as a new
cardboard box, and the plastic film is segregated by
polymer type and some of it returns for a second life as an
Asda Bag For Life.
In 450 Asda stores we offer recycling bins to collect
customers’ unwanted clothing, which is then used to raise
funds by our charity partners and kept out of landfill.
All our stores also have battery recycling bins and small
electrical drop off points at customer services. In our
larger stores we have customer recycling bins for all
types of plastic bags and film packaging – all of which we
send for recycling. At Asda Middleton we introduced a
dedicated recycling hub to take back the items customers
told us frustrated them most.

Food waste
Even though the GHG emissions associated with wasted food globally account for more
than those produced by global aviation,1 only 37% of UK customers realise that wasting
food contributes to climate change.2                                                                                                                                          Food Waste & Surplus Data*
When it comes to food waste, we need to think from farm to fork. That’s because in the UK
more than 9.5 Mt end up in the bin (or not consumed by humans). This is equivalent to 22%                                                                                        Food to Energy (tonnage)

Since those early beginnings we have expanded our charity donation programme
to include our home offices, our ambient depots and we are particularly proud
in 2020 to have achieved our goal of enabling all our stores1 to donate their
surplus through FareShare Go. This could not have come at a better time as food
poverty escalated as a result of the pandemic. To date this programme has seen
us donate edible surplus food equivalent to five million meals.
We work closely with FareShare Go to help our stores find partner charities
and groups for surplus food donations. FareShare recruits the charities and
makes sure they have the necessary food hygiene measures in place to provide
food to people in need. Our stores1 donate products from four areas: fruit and
vegetables, bakery, flowers and ambient (food that isn’t chilled). We work closely
with charities to offer timely donations and arrange collections. If the original
charity is unable to collect the donation on the same day we offer it to another charity.

Reduce
Our first priority is to eliminate all avoidable packaging without negatively
affecting food waste or overall planet impact. We focus on both weight
and piece changes in order to avoid inadvertently making things worse
by “lightweighting” a pack which is currently easy to recycle and instead
increasing its chance of ending up as street or ocean litter.
Back in 2017 we set ourselves a goal of reducing Asda Brand plastic by
10%; a goal which we achieved early and so extended to 15% reduction
on a like-for-like product list by 2021. We’re on track to achieve that goal,
having taken more than 9,300 tonnes of plastic out of more than 200
product ranges.1 We’ve also recently set ourselves an aspiration to remove
three billion individual pieces of plastic by 2025 and we’re off to a great
start. In 2019, we sold 535 million fewer Asda Brand pieces of plastic –
that’s the same as one item fewer in every customer basket.2
In 2018, we removed all single-use carrier bags from our stores and
extended that to online deliveries in 2019 (we temporarily reintroduced
them during Covid-19 for safety reasons). In 2020, we trialled removing
lightweight plastic bags in our fresh produce area and, following the
positive customer response, we rolled this out to all Asda stores, instead
offering 30p reusable and 100% recycled material bags. We’re still working
on viable alternatives to our heavier-weight reusable Bags For Life, that
will maintain convenience for all shoppers.
Reuse
Introducing packaging which can be reused has the potential to make a
big contribution to our efforts to reduce single-use packaging. This can
involve “refill” versions of everyday items like coffee or household cleaners
sold in compact or lighter weight packaging, as well as the introduction of
loose dispensed products which our customers can buy by the kilo using
their own reusable containers. Our first trial of Refill in our Middleton store
has been extremely encouraging and we’re learning a great deal about
the types of product, the operational systems and the ways we can help
our customers to engage with a new way of shopping. We’ll be rolling out
the successful aspects of Middleton to more stores as quickly as we can
and expect to have established Refill revenue streams across at least 40
products before 2025.
We’re also embracing “reuse” behind the scenes, and now move 96% of
our fresh meat and produce between depots and stores in heavy-duty
reusable crates.

•    COMMITMENT 9: Rapid expansion of cheaper,
     greener alternatives
Providing our customers with greener and
cheaper choices
Price is the number one reason customers cite as
a barrier preventing them from choosing greener
products. We are particularly passionate about ensuring
no customer is unable to participate in a greener
lifestyle just because they can’t afford it. Our “Greener
at Asda Price” promise means we’ll make it affordable
and accessible to all to choose the more
planet-friendly option.
Our actions to start this journey
To begin with that means working to guarantee that our
loose, unwrapped, compact and refill solutions are the
same price or cheaper than their standard alternatives.
Moving forward it means increasing our range of
products which help our customers reduce their
footprint whilst also saving money. We already offer a
25p discount off our café hot drinks when customers
bring a reusable cup and we aim to encourage and
reward other greener efforts in similar ways.
Our suppliers play a critical role in leading innovation
and renovation to drive this agenda. Often “Eco”
versions of regular products struggle to reach the
same sort of scale and therefore struggle to command
equivalent marketing budgets or shelf space – and
economically can struggle to generate efficiencies of
scale. Together with our suppliers we can work to make
these alternatives more competitive, more visible and
more mainstream, making greener choices part of
every basket.
In coming years we expect to attach specific sales
targets (%) to this commitment, as well as develop
incentive packages for our suppliers and reporting
on our progress. A key part of enabling this will be
the development of consistent data and definitions
described earlier.
                                                                              42

participate and lead throughout all the main industry working groups and we
will share progress of those groups regularly.

General Merchandise
While Asda’s primary business is food, our ‘everything under
one roof’ approach means we aim to make the shopping
experience easy for our customers by providing them with a
range of non-food products through our General Merchandise
(GM) division. We also have dedicated ‘Asda Living’ stores
which offer customers a range of Fashion, George Home and
other general merchandise products.
In 2020, we developed a new Better Planet strategy for
this division. We have three ambitions which will lead our
sustainability work.
By 2025 General Merchandise products will:
1.   Use innovative materials and fewer natural resources
2.   Help our customers to lead more sustainable lives
3.   Provide sustainable routes for when products reach the
     end of their useful life.
Where relevant, the GM sustainability commitments align to
those for Food and George clothing products. Our shared key
materials are cotton and polyester for textile products, paper
used in our greetings cards, gift wrap and palm oil within our
candles. Therefore, we work to make sure these all meet our
sustainable sourcing policies. Read more about our position
on these commodities on pages 25-27. We also address issues
specific to GM such as the use of peat in growing medium and
the use of glitter and single-use plastic items in our festive and
celebrations ranges.
Our GM ranges cover Cook and Dine, Homeware and Textiles,
Toy and Entertainment, Outdoor and Gardening as well as
seasonal items such as Christmas decorations and Halloween
items. Many of these items fall under the scope of ‘own-brand’
meaning that they either hold the George Home branding or
have been exclusively designed for us through collaborations
such as Disney. George Home was launched in 2014, focusing
on the same pillars that have become synonymous with the
George clothing brand for over two decades – quality, style
and value.

Festive fun with less plastic
We know that our customers want to celebrate the festive season with
our great range of products but they don’t want to be left with excessive
plastic to deal with. We set to work understanding which products we
could remove plastic from. Glitter was identified as a high-risk area and
so in 2019 we created a policy to remove plastic glitter from many of
our 2020 Christmas products. Through product innovation and supplier
collaboration all our own label loose festive cards, boxed cards, wrapping
paper, gift bags, festive houseplants and flowers no longer contain
plastic glitter.
Plastic within packaging is also an area we wanted to tackle. All acetate
from crackers packaging has been removed and one of our cracker sets
is fully recyclable meaning the packaging, cracker and the gift inside are
all recyclable. Finally, we have introduced a new bay of sustainable festive
products to help direct our customers and highlight sustainable choices.
We also learn from our trials and understand that we may not be able
to get things right the first time, for example we have been testing and
innovating on removal of the plastic wrap surrounding our tubes of fully
recyclable wrapping paper – however all our tests show that alternative
solutions create waste due to product damage and so we were unable to
to implement a solution for Christmas 2020 but we are pleased with the
learnings so far.
       Did you know?
       To make our ambitions a reality, we want to help our
       colleagues do everything they can to help us accelerate our
       journey. We’ll be providing new sustainable product guidelines
       – giving everyone involved in product design and production
       the clarity they need to get this right. We’ll also offer training
       sessions on how to tackle more challenging materials. As our
       GM teams continue to make progress in 2021, we will also
       develop a similar approach for our non-edible products.

                              a very different supply chain, different materials
                              and distinct product life cycles compared with our
                              food business, a specialised approach is needed.
                              To reduce its environmental footprint, George
is exploring the sustainable sourcing of key materials, cutting
hazardous waste, optimising packaging and identifying circular
solutions. George is increasingly expanding its efforts to protect the
environment, in addition to its long-standing focus on human rights.

Responsibly sourced fibres
The way fashion and homeware brands like George source materials
for products can have a big impact on the environment and people’s
livelihoods in production countries. To maximise its positive impact,
George focuses on the materials it uses most – cotton, polyester
and viscose, as well as timber and palm oil, materials it shares with
Asda’s food business. We have already made strong progress as                                                     BCI_Kolondieba_Mali_2019-50: BCI/Seun Adatsi                    BCI_cottongeneral_1: BCI

Cotton
•      By 2025, all our cotton for own-brand clothing and soft
       home textile products will be responsibly sourced
As the UK’s second largest clothing retailer by volume, George’s
commitment to source cotton more responsibly will help to
increase both demand and supply. To achieve our goal, we will
work with our own-brand clothing and soft home textiles suppliers
to source cotton through programmes such as the Better Cotton
Initiative (BCI) of which we’re a member through Walmart. George
is committed to improving cotton farming practices globally with
the BCI which is the largest cotton sustainability programme in the
world. Together with its partners, the programme provides training
on more sustainable farming practices to more than two million
cotton farmers across 23 countries. Better Cotton is sourced via a
system of Mass Balance and so is not physically traceable to end
products. As of 2020, 60% of the cotton we sourced was through
the Better Cotton Initiative.1 But it doesn’t stop there; we are also
working with our suppliers to include recycled and organic content
in some of our products as we continue on our cotton journey.

Polyester
•       We are committed to sourcing 100% of our polyester with a minimum of
        30% recycled content by 2025
Polyester is an artificial fibre made from oil and is used widely around the world.
Approximately 26% of George clothing is made from this fibre, so it’s important that we
innovate to source recycled polyester, in order to reduce the strain on natural resources
and keep fossil fuels in the ground. Recycled polyester is generally made from plastic
(PET) bottles, and this is a great way of diverting waste that could potentially end up
in landfills or in our oceans. Our sourcing of recycled polyester is governed by third-
party certificate schemes such as Global Recycled Standard (GRS) and Recycled Claim
Standard (RCS).
Viscose
•       We are committed to sourcing viscose from traceable sources with a low
        environmental impact.
Viscose is typically derived from wood pulp and agricultural crops that are regenerated
as cellulose fibre. So we must make sure that the forests we source from are not                                                                                  The 2019 and 2020 data below are for the total of responsibly sourced cotton,

chain to complete a chemical waste management survey, which
has provided insights into priority areas such as fabric mills and
wet finishing processes. George is aligned with ZDHC, an industry-

•       We will actively participate in the Microfibre
        Consortium to reduce ocean plastics
Microfibres are increasingly identified by scientists as a major
source of ocean pollution. There are also concerns that they are
entering the food chain, and may carry other harmful chemicals.
While exact figures on the clothing and home textiles industry’s
impact are not available, we have already taken action to address
this important topic. We were the first big supermarket to
sign up to The Microfibre Consortium (TMC), which promotes
the development of practical solutions for the textile industry
to minimise the release of microfibres into the environment
from textile manufacturing and during throughout their useful
life, including when clothes are washed by consumers. TMC is
looking to connect in-depth academic research with the reality
of commercial supply chains
to help brands, retailers and
supplier members better
understand the challenges

                                   to return any hangers they’ve taken home with their
                                   purchases. Since 2018, our customers have returned over
                                   3,000 tonnes of plastic hangers to our stores. In 2019, we
                                   reused 29% of our hangers.

                                   •   All our George care labels, since the end of
                                       2020, are now made from recycled polyester
                                   •   All George packaging will be 100% recyclable
                                       by 2025
                                   The challenges we face for recyclable packaging are
                                   around the stickers we use, which currently cannot be
                                   recycled at kerbside.
                                   Plastic reduction
                                   •   We are aiming for the polybags that display our
                                       clothes in stores to have at least 30% recycled

                                       the FSC as of the end of 2020
                                   •   By 2025, all primary paper-based packaging will
                                       be from sustainable sources
                                   Currently over 80% of our paper packaging has moved to

George Cares
George Cares is our commitment to our customers to provide
high-quality, long-lasting products to help people get through
the rough and tumble of life. In recent years, we have taken this
further by trialling new circular solutions that go beyond durable
products to help reduce, reuse and recycle – giving products a
second life and keeping them in use for as long as possible.
Durable and long-lasting clothing
To ensure George products offer the best value for money,
we focus on four key areas: developing, fitting, checking and
listening. Our products are fitted on real people of all shapes
and sizes by our expert technologists, and thoroughly tested by
certified laboratories. We ask a variety of people to try and test
them, including our own colleagues, to ensure they meet our
satisfaction guarantee.
George works closely with our supplier partners to produce
the end product, offering training to their teams through our
George Academy, and helping them to reach and maintain our
standards.
Making the most of customer feedback
                                                                   WE OFFER A 100-DAY
Customer feedback means a lot to Asda, and we encourage            GUARANTEE ON ALL GEORGE
George customers to keep us updated with their views on price,
quality and fit. Our online reviews show that 92.8% of reviewers
                                                                   CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR

Reduce, reuse, repurpose and recycle
George works with third parties to reduce, reuse, repurpose and recycle all
end-of-line ranges, customer returns and withdrawn or rejected stock. All
sampling generated through our buying processes are resold to colleagues,
with funds going to charity. George also works with charities such as Newlife
and His Church to provide vital funds through the donation of our customer
returns. In addition, over 400 Asda stores have clothing banks in their car
parks; this is where customers can donate unwanted clothing and raise money
for charities such as Tickled Pink.
In 2020, we formed a partnership with Sheffield-based Vintage Kilo, who
supply high-quality vintage, retro and second-hand branded clothing. Our
Preloved Vintage offer was launched at our Middleton sustainability store in
October and has proven very popular with customers. As a result, it has now
grown to a further nine Asda stores in Scotland and the north of England, all
of which launched in December 2020. We are excited to be offering premium
vintage and retro clothing at affordable prices to our customers. We have
plans to roll Preloved out to an additional 40 Asda stores by the end of April
2021, 50 stores in total, following the success of our Middleton store trial.

Our Better Communities’ vision
Community is a word you’ll hear often at Asda. Across stores,
distribution centres and home offices, we’re proud to be part of the
local communities we operate in.
As one of the largest employers in town, we
see it as our responsibility to build stronger       “OUR BETTER COMMUNITIES’
communities, and to connect and convene others
to make a collective impact. This year, more than    WORK FOCUSES ON MAKING
ever, we’ve seen the power of connectivity and
community, as friends, neighbours, businesses        A DIFFERENCE IN THE AREAS
and charities have pulled together to support
each other, find solutions to seemingly impossible
                                                     THAT MATTER TO OUR
situations and look after the most vulnerable
in society.
                                                     CUSTOMERS.”
Our better communities’
work focuses on making
a difference in the
areas that matter to our
customers. Through our
network of community
champions and
fundraising initiatives,
we take real action to
make a positive change
to poverty, tackle breast
cancer, support children
and families in crisis and
build stronger, more
resilient communities.
In any given year, we
partner with thousands
of charities, community
groups and local good
causes to support
projects that make our
communities a better
place to live.

 How our Community Champions help
 From outreach programmes to grant giving, our Community Champions
 listen to our communities’ needs and work with local people to make sure
 we’re providing support to those who need it most. They work tirelessly to
 support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real impact for local
 people. They also build close relationships with local schools, working with
 teachers to promote healthy food and an active lifestyle, enthusing children
 about cooking and talking to them about protecting the environment. In
 2019, our Community Champions worked with over 15,000 local groups
 across the UK, and reached 2,791 schools.1
 Every year, Asda Community Champions…
 •       Provide space in our stores to local groups to raise awareness of
         services available within the community, collect food for food banks
         and support fundraising for local charities. Some of our stores also
         have rooms available free of charge that community groups can use to
         hold meetings.
 •       Run fundraising events in our stores, through bag packing, bucket
         collections and by donating goods to fundraising events. Our
         Community Champions have also taken part in some remarkable
         colleague fundraising events – from shaving their hair off to running
         marathons. In everything they do, they make us all incredibly proud.
 •       Each Champion also has a monthly budget for monetary and product
         donations to provide practical support to local charities. They also
         coordinate the in-store Green Token Giving scheme, funded by the
         Asda Foundation.

Case studies
Helping people forge new friendships
To tackle social isolation within her community, Liz Cotterill set
up a friendship café at our Warrington store to bring people
together on a regular basis. Now, a group of around 16 people
meet up regularly to play dominoes, knit blankets for local care
homes, discuss books and taste test Asda’s cakes. They also
have regular guests who provide talks about issues in the local
community and where to get support.
“GRANDPARENTS BRING GRANDKIDS
ALONG AND NEW PARENTS CAN MEET

ARE HAPPY TO HELP THEM WITH ADVICE

FRIENDS ARE FOR…”

Connecting local groups for good
Diane Springthorpe from our Colne store ran an inspiring
networking event for local charity groups in her in-store
community room. This enabled local groups to meet for the first
time, establish new connections, and even join forces to support
people in crisis during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Asda Foundation
Asda Foundation is an independent charity with more than 30 years’
history of helping people in local communities, and has donated more
than £40 million to date. Its mission is to transform communities
and improve lives throughout the UK, complementing Asda Stores’
ambition to be at the heart of local communities, through building
long-term community resilience and being there in times of crisis.
The Foundation supports grassroots organisations in making a real
impact, and supports local communities in emergencies, reacting
quickly to help people in the immediate hours following a disaster.
In 2020, Asda Foundation committed more than £4.5 million to
communities across the UK. These grants focus on supporting small,
local activities, and range from £50 to £25,000. We fund all sorts of
projects, from school uniforms to Christmas lunches to refurbishing a
community centre kitchen – helping to make a positive difference to
all involved.
Back in 2012, we were one of the first retailers to enable customers
to vote in store for funding to go to local good causes. At Asda, we
call this Green Token Giving. Since its launch, we have supported over
5,000 local good causes annually. In 2020, we donated over £1 million
through this innovative scheme. We also offer our colleagues match
funding for their own charity fundraising efforts.
In 2020, Asda Foundation adapted its traditional grant programmes
to support people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. We are also
accelerating our plans to use digital technology to reach and support
more communities, and engage more customers. For example, in
2021, we plan to trial a digital version of our Green Token Giving
Programme. We also plan to make grant applications a fully digital,
paperless process, making things easier for communities and
contributing to Asda’s sustainability mission.
Providing emergency support
Asda Foundation supports communities through emergencies,
helping them to get rapid, practical help in the event of disaster.
This ranges from personal emergencies, such as house fires, to those
affecting whole communities, such as storms and floods. For instance,
at the end of 2019, we helped people affected by the floods in South
Yorkshire to get back on their feet by sending a lorry with cleaning
supplies as well as baby food and premixed baby milk.

Fighting poverty
Poverty is a growing issue in the UK, impacted even
more by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Over
14 million people nationally live below the poverty
line, and just below a third of those affected are
children. Yet at the same time, 4.4 million tonnes1 of
edible food is wasted in the UK each year and as a
food retailer, it’s important to us that we do what we
can to make a difference.
We’ve been on a journey since 2018, partnering with
FareShare and the Trussell Trust to provide support
for people in crisis today and working towards a
tomorrow where there is no need for food banks in
DONATING OVER £25
MILLION SINCE 2018 TO
FARESHARE AND THE
TRUSSELL TRUST, TOGETHER
WE’LL FIGHT POVERTY
AND CREATE LONG-TERM
POSITIVE CHANGE
the UK. Donating over £25 million since 2018 to these
two leading charities, together we’ll fight poverty and
create long-term, positive change. As a retailer, the
greatest contribution we can make is alleviating the
symptoms of poverty by providing more meals and
putting edible surplus food to good use. However,
the issue of poverty is highly complex, and there
shouldn’t be a need for food banks, so whilst we do
what we can to provide people with food, we’re also
on a mission to tackle the root causes of poverty.

Lindsay Boswell, CEO FareShare
Since the launch of our Fight Hunger Create Change programme, we have
supported FareShare in expanding its activities by funding infrastructure
improvements including new warehouses, chillers, forklift trucks and
warehouse retrofits at FareShare premises across the UK. This means that
FareShare have been able to double the amount of food they can handle
in their network, ultimately providing more food to local charities. Through
capacity building alone, FareShare have provided over 46 million additional
meals, exceeding our target of 24 million meals. On top of this, our support
to FareShare during the pandemic provided another five million meals.
Our Community Champions and media investment has also encouraged
more food donations in store, and between 2018 and 2020 our customers
and colleagues donated enough food to provide over five million meals to
support local food banks.

Supporting our local food bank
Our Middlesbrough store’s Community

Area Food Bank to better service people
living in poverty by setting up a permanent
edible surplus food collection point in store
and volunteering at the food bank. Jenny also
supported the food bank with a £5,000 Asda
Foundation grant to help expand its reach.

Breast Cancer Now is now the largest breast cancer charity in the UK2 with the aim to
connect anyone affected by breast cancer to trained nurses to seek advice. In 2020
we fundraised £3.3 million to support its efforts, helping the charity to reach 1,780,153
people through its award-winning helpline and life-changing support services.
Working with charity CoppaFeel!, a new Tickled Pink partner introduced in 2020, we are
stepping up our promotion of the importance of regular boob and pec checking and
raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer. With engaging in-store
and social media campaigns, together we aim to increase monthly checking among
18-24 year-olds in the UK from 36% to 47%, which could mean an extra 600,000 young
people adopting regular boob checking behaviour by 2024.

 Engaging our colleagues and customers
 Our in-store campaign fundraising and
 awareness activities are delivered primarily by
 our Community Champions. We try to be as
 disruptive and engaging as possible with our
 boob checking messages ranging from stickering
 check messaging on Asda own-label products
 to providing dedicated leaflets and resources
 with self-checking advice. The success of these
 campaigns was recognised by the charity sector,
 with Asda winning a 2020 Business Charity
 Award1 and being highly commended at the Third
 Sector Charity awards.2 Moreover, it has enabled
 our boob check messaging on our till receipts to
 become a mainstay, now being included on every

Disadvantaged Children
Through our partnerships and campaigns, we raise funds to enable local projects and services
to support disadvantaged children and help them to remove barriers and negative factors that
can prevent them from reaching their potential. Our main partnership is with BBC Children in
Need. Over the past 21 years, we’ve raised over £26 million to support disadvantaged children
and young people across the UK. In 2020, we supported the BBC Children in Need Big Night
In and November TV appeals, helping to raise over £2 million. Through the £2.5 million raised
by Asda in 2019, we supported BBC Children in Need to fund over 200 projects delivering
play activities and opportunities, reaching over 30,000 children and young people. Our
funding supported a variety of projects including activity workshops for children in hospices,
playworkers for youth groups, play equipment and play respite care.

Our Better Lives vision
We all want to live long, healthy and happy
lives. At Asda, we are making nutritious food
affordable and appealing, with health-focused
communications, support for public health
campaigns and innovation in our
own-brand products.
In the UK, we face many dietary challenges. We
eat too much saturated fat and sugar and not
enough vegetables and fibre. Around one third of
children leaving primary school1 and two thirds of
adults are overweight or obese.2 It’s an issue that
affects underprivileged communities the most. A
2018 Food Foundation study found that half of UK
households may not be able to afford a healthy
diet3 and 67% of our customers feel the key barrier
to maintaining a healthy diet is affordability.4
Additionally, a lack of knowledge around healthy
eating and cooking skills, together with busy
lifestyles, are also barriers to good nutrition. The
financial burden of obesity and related conditions
to the NHS is estimated to be over £6 billion
each year.5
Obesity and the Covid-19 pandemic
Obesity is associated with many chronic diseases,6
including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes,
at least some types of cancer, liver and respiratory
disease, in addition to having negative impacts
on mental health. A Public Health England Report
suggests that people who are overweight or
obese are at an increased risk of serious COVID-19                                                           WE’RE WORKING HARD TO PROVIDE HEALTHIER,

Responsible sourcing
Protecting the human rights of all who contribute to
our business – from our employees to the workers in
our supply chain – is not only the right thing to do, it’s
essential to our future success. Partnering with our
suppliers and their facilities globally, we work to mitigate
risks, drive remediation and improve standards for
workers via our risk-based approach.
We expect suppliers to operate responsibly through
abiding by applicable labour and employment laws
and adhering to our Standard for Suppliers. These
standards form the cornerstone of our programme and
lay out how we expect our suppliers to cascade the
requirement throughout our supply chains across the
globe. Transparency is key to this approach and it allows
us to manage and mitigate risk via a robust monitoring
programme that focuses on risk, the closure of any non-
conformances and continuous improvement.
Our global programme focuses on forced labour,
underage labour, unsafe working conditions and violence
and harassment against women. We currently use third
party social, safety and environmental compliance audits
to help us evaluate our suppliers’ overall compliance and
to manage risk in the supply chain. These audits seek
to monitor whether, among other things, workers are
properly paid for the work they do, labour is voluntary,
workers are not being exploited, working hours are not
excessive and are consistent with local laws, and facilities
meet health and safety laws and regulations.
Collective action and collaboration is vital to driving
improvement into global supply chains and at Asda we

 Preventing modern slavery
 Modern slavery is a complex and often hidden issue affecting an estimated
 40.3 million people worldwide1. Within Asda’s business and supply chain, we do not
 tolerate modern slavery. In line with the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015, we began
 a strategic journey in 2015 to identify, prevent and tackle instances of modern
 slavery in our business and supply chain, and have now published our fourth
 Modern Slavery Statement2. As part of this effort, we also provide training to our
 suppliers and help our colleagues recognise and report potential signs of
 modern slavery.
 Asda is a member of Stronger Together, an alliance working to reduce the risks of
 forced labour and human trafficking by providing resources for suppliers. In 2019,
 the UK Responsible Sourcing team collaborated with Stronger Together to help
 Asda colleagues identify indicators of modern slavery within their daily lives – a first
 within the retail sector and a new area for Stronger Together. Learn more about our
 approach to modern slavery via our website.3

  THE STRONGER TOGETHER CONSUMER GOODS
  STEERING GROUP IN 2013, AND HELPS EMPLOYEES
  WITHIN THEIR BUSINESS, THROUGHOUT THEIR
  UK SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE WIDER SECTOR TO
  SPOT THE SIGNS OF FORCED LABOUR AND TAKE
  ACTION AGAINST IT.”

 Supporting victims of modern slavery
 To help victims of slavery move forward with their lives, we offer practical support
 to help people gain confidence, find jobs and live independently. We’re doing this by
 supporting the Bright Future programme which is an employment programme first
 developed by the Co-op and their charity partners, to provide victims of modern
 slavery with a pathway to paid employment and reintegration into society.4
 While we are making progress, we know there is still some way to go. As the Covid-19
 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges for us all, we remain committed to
 protecting the most vulnerable. Please see our Modern Slavery Statement for                                                                                                                                                    Alan Fraser Images / Shutterstock.com

Towards greater transparency
Apparel supply chains are complex and fragmented, reaching across the
world and providing a livelihood for millions of people. Yet they’re also
vulnerable to poor labour conditions. Understanding the behaviour and
practices of our suppliers – and their suppliers – is tough but essential to
raising standards and building transparency. It’s the right thing for our
suppliers and their workers, our customers, and ultimately, our business.
Our ultimate ambition is for 100% transparency across our
supply chain   
We publicly disclose lists of our 1st Tier1 and 2nd Tier2 apparel facilities
and we are continuously expanding our transparency journey. Tier
1 means our direct facilities, these are primary production factories,
including any standalone stitching units. Tier 2 includes any printing,
embroidery, washing, packaging and finishing units. We have also
listed all nominated fabric mills and trim suppliers. Our key challenge
is understanding what’s happening at the farm level. Working with the
Better Cotton Initiative and CanopyStyle, we are taking steps to build
farmers’ capacity to adopt sustainable practices and insight into their
ongoing performance.
Promoting workers’ rights in the supply chain
When you choose an item of clothing from George, it’s likely it has been
produced by a female factory worker. In Bangladesh alone, over 80% of
the four million people employed in the garment industry are women.3
Looking after their welfare is something we take very seriously, and we’re
supporting them in a number of ways. Importantly, we’re helping our
suppliers create a safe, respectful working environment, improve labour
conditions and prevent harassment.

Supplier support
Our suppliers are important strategic partners and we
strive to be fair and clear in all our dealings with them.
As one of the UK’s largest grocers, we are governed by
the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP), a set
of legal rules for grocery retailers on managing supplier
relationships. The Groceries Code Adjudicator survey
undertaken in the first quarter of 2020 showed that for the
previous 12 months, 94% of Asda’s suppliers believe that
we comply with the Code ‘consistently well’ or ‘mostly’
well. We’re also going further by making fair treatment

International Procurement and Logistics
Food processing business International Procurement
and Logistics (or IPL) was acquired by Asda in 2009 and
sources a variety of different products from around the
world for our customers, ranging from fresh fruit and
vegetables, nuts and dried fruit, house plants and flowers
to award-winning wines. We are supporting IPL in raising
social, environmental and ethical standards in its supply
chain, while keeping food affordable and tackling key
issues like food poverty and food waste.
IPL assesses any new supplier’s practices carefully and has
its own Modern Slavery Policy. In 2020, IPL began a major
effort to help its suppliers improve their performance on
protecting the environment, covering important areas like
water, soil, food waste and plastics.

Better Business Supplier support: British Sourcing
Strengthening our Supply Chain and Renewing
our commitment to British sourcing
As we move ahead under our new ownership, we
wanted to reassure our customers that we’re still
committed to offering low prices and supporting
British suppliers. So in 2020, we announced our
intention to source a higher-proportion of products
from UK-based suppliers. This will cover a range of
products such as chicken, dairy, wheat and potatoes,
as well as a commitment to source 100% British
beef by the end of 2021. Throughout this effort, we’ll
retain a strong focus on quality. We want to retain
the top spot, having won 2020 Meat Retailer of the
year at the Food Quality Awards.
On a broader basis we plan to invest over £1 billion
over the next three years into our business and into
strengthening the resiliency of our supply chain.
      WE’RE COMMITTED TO
      SOURCING 100% BRITISH
      BEEF BY THE END OF 2021
Stepping up our focus on local sourcing
We know that more customers are interested in
‘buying local’ and we’re working with more than 300
local suppliers who now provide more than 2,000
product lines into our stores. We’re also helping local
suppliers to understand how to build a relationship
with Asda by running supplier academies in
Northern Ireland and Scotland in partnership with
local authorities. At these sessions we provide
expert advice and give suppliers an inside look at
how our depots and stores work. 35 suppliers took
part in 2019, and overall, more than 200 people
have benefited from these courses to date. We will
continue to expand the programme’s reach and
flexibility with online modules, and we’ll keep on
optimising our local ranges.

sustainability is tough for us all. We cannot alone
influence the major social and environmental
issues we’re addressing through our strategy.
We are also partly reliant on technological
advances and the contribution and commitment
of partners and suppliers, and are affected by
external factors such as political will, policy
changes, economic uncertainty and market
volatility. We’ll be clear about our challenges and
honest about barriers to progress. But we won’t
stop trying and we won’t be afraid to try new
solutions and learn from our experiences – for

Governing and
managing sustainability
In 2020 we reviewed and refreshed the way we oversee
our Creating Change for Better programme and manage
sustainability issues. This has enabled us to create a consistent
approach across the entire business. We have focused our
efforts on how we position ourselves to make the greatest
impact, and harness our agility to navigate changing dynamics
and evolving challenges. Our new governance structure
will also support us in building trust and championing our
customers’ needs, as we strive to be a more responsible and
sustainable retailer.

ownership and responsibilities for ESG issues at Asda:
