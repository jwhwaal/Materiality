Group,
it was a highlight of our digital REWE Group Dialogue Forum in May 2021:
Prof. Dr. Richard David Precht gave his keynote speech entitled ""Opportunities and
Challenges of Sustainability in Pandemic Times"". And we were able to witness how the
philosopher and publicist made a passionate plea for realistic optimism - as a prerequisite for facing the
as a prerequisite for successfully mastering the enormous ecological and social challenges that lie ahead
of us.
challenges that lie ahead of us. I was impressed by his concrete examples
and especially his sentence: ""Companies can show politicians what is possible.""
We at REWE Group should understand this sentence as a mission and an incentive. In fact, it is
fact, we have already been active in the past, both on our own and together, in sector initiatives
and have shown politicians what is possible. Prominent examples are the
Animal Welfare Initiative, our commitment against the killing of chicks, the elimination of plastic

We do not want to and should not wait until regulatory and legal barriers always and everywhere prevent

In this endeavor, we are certainly not perfect; we also make mistakes and sometimes take
and sometimes take paths that, on closer examination, prove to be inappropriate. In our commitment to

to become

But out of conviction and responsibility, we have set out to become an increasingly sustainable company.

* The disability quota is calculated on a per capita basis and thus has a different calculation basis than
the mandatory employment quota of
severely disabled persons in accordance with Section 154 of the German Social Code IX (Germany). The
calculation of the disability quota by headcount was chosen in order to
to be able to determine a uniform figure across all countries (Germany and Austria). The definition of
people with
disabilities is in accordance with Social Code (SGB) § 2 (Germany) and Disability Employment Act
(BEinstG) (Austria).

the umbrella of the strategy, to which specific measures are aligned.
The basis for the strategy development was a comprehensive analysis of the sustainability risks and
impacts of REWE Group in the supply chains of its private label products. Other important
important components of the strategy development were the survey of stakeholders and customers as
well as political and

sustainability strategy, which is increasingly becoming an integral part of the purchasing processes and
requires a close exchange with direct and indirect suppliers. From the analysis
25 aspects have emerged from the analysis, which REWE Group has summarized for the
operationalization of the strategy in the
following fields of action:
●
People
●
Animal
●
Environment
The strategy is implemented through a comprehensive management approach, which defines the
Principles and tools to implement the measures defined:
1.
Risk analyses:
REWE Group continuously assesses opportunities and risks in the area of sustainability.
On the one hand, these analyses are based on external analyses of merchandise areas, specific
products or raw material supply chains. On the other hand, the assessment and experience
of the external NGO Advisory Board for Sustainability, as well as other stakeholders such as
producers, suppliers and also employees.
2.
Derivation of focus areas and targets:
On the basis of the risk analyses carried out, focus raw materials and topics, as well as
and measures were defined, which are adapted and questioned in the event of new results or

are presented.
Fruit and vegetables

From suppliers of primary agricultural products in the fruit and vegetable sector, the
REWE Group has required suppliers of primary agricultural products in the fruit and vegetable sector since
2013 to commit to the core labor standards of the
of the International Labor Organization (ILO) within the framework of the applicable national legislation.

applicable legal, collectively agreed or contractually agreed wage. Both requirements are
mandatory and must be verifiable by suppliers. Suppliers are also
also have a responsibility to ensure that these requirements are also met by their suppliers. All
producers of fruit and vegetable products must accordingly verify compliance with the above-mentioned
requirements mentioned above in the form of external audits (e.g. GLOBALG.A.P. Risk
Assessment on Social Practice (GRASP), SA8000, Rainforest Alliance or amfori BSCI).
Random audits are used to verify compliance with the requirements.
In addition to the social aspects in fruit and vegetable production, REWE
Group is also committed to reducing the ecological impact. This includes the promotion of
biodiversity through specific projects, for example in fruit and vegetable cultivation in
Germany, specifications on the use of pesticides and cooperation with standards such as the
Rainforest Alliance or Fairtrade.

the production of grass paper generates fewer greenhouse gases than the production of
conventional paper from virgin fiber or waste paper. The raw material for the grass pellets comes
from unused compensation areas in the immediate vicinity of the paper mill. This means that the
grass packaging has a comparatively good eco-balance.
At present, REWE Group uses packaging made of grass paper, for example, for the PENNY
Naturgut organic apples nationally, PENNY Naturgut organic vine tomatoes nationally and REWE organic

In classic incubators, individual animals are left unsupplied for up to 36 hours - with the result,
that the early-hatched chicks lose up to ten percent of their hatching weight due to dehydration and
and lose vitality and robustness. One solution is innovative early-feeding
systems with which REWE Group is the first food retailer in Germany to address the issue of
animal welfare after hatching. There are currently two different systems: the
HatchCare process and the ""hatch-in-the-house"" systems. Both procedures ensure that
animals are provided with the basic necessities of life immediately after hatching.

In the HatchCare process, as soon as the chick is hatched, it slides in with the other animals in
a separate basket in the incubator. In the two-tier incubator baskets - so-called hordes
with a maximum of 90 eggs each - the newly hatched chicks automatically slide to the lower level.

and to take in drinking water and feed immediately after hatching.
In addition, the incubators are illuminated and thus provide hatching conditions with more
animal welfare. Since spring 2017, the first chicks have been hatching in the hatcheries using the new
process.

In the so-called ""hatch-in-house"" systems, the chicks hatch directly in the fattening house.
This eliminates the need for the chicks to hatch in the hatchery and the transport, which often takes
several hours.
The chicks also have direct access to feed and water in the barn.
Both methods achieve positive results: Through early feeding and
drinking water supply, optimal climate control and sufficient space and light prevent developmental
developmental disorders are prevented. All chicks get a more consistent and vital start
into their lives. Chick mortality can also be significantly reduced in this way.

to end this practice.
With this in mind, REWE Group is pursuing the goal of 100 percent chick-kill-free
supply chains for processed private label products by the end of 2022. Before then, the
REWE and PENNY sales lines will already switch fresh private label eggs to chick-kill-free supply chains by

successively replace the previous Green Building concept for new buildings.
Elements of the Green Building concept
In detail, the concept contains the following elements which, depending on the general conditions at the
implemented at the various locations:
1.
Daylight architecture: A window light strip on up to four sides of the building as well as additional
roof light domes allow the use of natural light, which is provided by an energy-efficient
energy-efficient LED lighting concept. The natural incidence of light also contributes

used in the

3.
Renewable energy: The Green Building stores, like all other REWE Group stores, warehouses
and travel agencies of REWE Group are supplied with 100 per cent certified green electricity. Where
photovoltaic systems are installed where it makes sense to do so.

4.
Heat supply: Fossil fuels are used to supply heat through the use of heat pumps and waste heat
and the use of waste heat from the refrigeration plants.
5.
Rainwater utilization: For floor cleaning, toilet flushing and outdoor irrigation, rainwater is
rainwater is collected in collecting tanks wherever possible.
6.
Refrigeration technology and refrigeration units: The natural refrigerant CO2 is used for refrigeration and
refrigerant CO2 is used for normal and deep-freeze refrigeration units and the natural refrigerant
propene is used. Buffer storage units are used for heat recovery, glazed
wall-mounted refrigerated display cases for meat and dairy products allow less cold to escape. The
energy efficiency of the refrigerated display cases is also enhanced by integrated LED lighting,
energy-saving fans and the elimination of window heaters for frozen food cabinets.
7.
Socio-cultural factors: Green Building stores are largely barrier-free and equipped with
handicapped toilets and baby changing facilities. In addition, factors such as visual
comfort, indoor air quality and bicycle parking near the entrance are also taken into account.
