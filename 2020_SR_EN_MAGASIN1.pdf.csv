                                     More than ever, it has2020 been a year of struggle.
                                     All Groupement U employees have mobilized and adapted with courage and
                                     success to ensure the continuity of our supplies with our partners, in
                                     particular our suppliers, whether they are producers, very small businesses
                                     or SMEs. In solidarity with our day-to-day partners, we have acted to
                                     continue to serve our customers by ensuring their safety and that of our
                                     employees, and to continue, despite everything, our societal and
                                     environmental responsibility initiatives in this deteriorated context.
                                     Our cooperative model allows us to respond to economic and social
                                     expectations, as close as possible to the concerns of our customers.
           We are moving forward in a new context: no longer just that of measuring economic performance,
           but also that of the impact of our activity. Behind the health, social and economic crisis that is
           mobilizing us, a much more important wave is taking shape. The new climate and the ecological
           crisis necessarily imply more sustainable development, a societal change that we must anticipate
           and in which we play a full part. This is already the world we live in today, and it will become
           even more concrete tomorrow. Every day, it pushes us to pave the way for an ever more
           responsible consumption, anchored in the ultra-local founding of our Group.
           Challenges remain, notably that of access to this responsible consumption.
           We have long worked on the subject of improving nutrition, including the continued removal of
           controversial substances from our U-brand products, but consumption must also contribute on its
           own scale to environmental preservation, on which our work has begun and must continue to go
           further.
           Our ambition is to market responsible and accessible products in stores that are also
           responsible and accessible. This is why we are working hard, as this report proves, on the
           way we build our stores, with respect for the land and in harmony with their environment; on
           the way we operate them, with a concern for energy sobriety and performance; on the way we
           supply them, thanks to ever more economical and less noisy logistics; and finally on the way
           we offer consumers the possibility of using them, whether it be through successful bulk
           concepts, committed solutions against waste or initiatives that give a very
           We are also pursuing the objective of more inclusive growth, with a social dimension that is not
           forgotten. At the same time, we are pursuing the objective of more inclusive growth, with a social
           dimension that is not forgotten.
           In the face of these future challenges, we will find our strengths in our cooperative model, in
           our DNA as merchants rooted in the territories, in the commitment and collective strength of
           our associates and employees for a more responsible consumption.
           2020 has been a year of constant commitment to the supply of French people. For the years to
           come, it will require us to be equally optimistic, resolutely committed and focused on the
           challenges facing us.

           Because our company puts more than billions2 of U-branded everyday products on the market every year, we
           are taking action to better produce and manage the waste associated with our activity.
           Convinced that the best waste is the one we don't produce, we aim first and foremost to minimize our
           production of waste - food and non-food - and, for unavoidable waste, to promote its recovery.
           In order to respond to the risk of producing unnecessary waste, our commitment to reduce and
           recycle waste is broken down into the following objectives3:
           - Designing an offer and sales methods that minimize the production of non-recyclable waste
           - Promote circular economy loops
           - Taking action to reduce waste

          IMPROVE ENERGY PERFORMANCE
          Mitigating the risk of increased global warming is an objective of U Enseigne in two ways:
          - reducing the climate impact of goods transport, which is delegated to a number of transport service450
            providers in the region and accounts for more than 90% of U Enseigne's GHG emissions linked to the
            distribution activity to and from the points of sale.
          - Encourage energy efficiency actions in our stores and logistics sites through our role of recommendation
            and guidance to the Group's members.
          In these two areas, in which it does not operate directly, U Enseigne wishes to encourage better practices.

          products or the ingredients of our Produits U. We wish to contribute to a sustainable food supply and give
          priority to national and local supplies. We also intend to be active alongside the agricultural world in its
          search for sustainable and responsible agriculture. This is why we support and promote in our offer the
          agricultural approaches of preservation and reconstruction of biodiversity.
          To respond to the risk of damage to biodiversity, our commitments are focused on two objectives:

          SUPPORT ANIMAL HUSBANDRY PRACTICES THAT
          RESPECT ANIMAL WELFARE
          Given the variety of animal-based food products marketed by U
          (milk, eggs, meat, processed products, etc.), U Enseigne is aware of its responsibility in terms of animal
          welfare. It is encouraged by the increased attention paid by society to the animal cause.
          In response to the risk of deterioration in the quality of life of farm animals, our objective is to improve their
          rearing, transport and slaughter conditions. In addition to improving the harmony of the animal with its
          environment, this improvement allows us to guarantee the quality of the finished products and to
          participate in the advent of a more coherent agriculture.
