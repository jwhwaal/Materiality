    Sustainability Report 2020
    We are in the middle
    Sustainable action is strategy
    EDEKA Südwest has set itself 25 sustainability targets for 2025.
    Of these, we have already achieved four by 2020. Five new targets
    have been added. Why? Because sustainable action is an ongoing
    project and a principle of entrepreneurial action.

    Every day anew it is a question of our common future
    For us, being in the thick of things means achieving our goals, defining new tasks
    and implementing measures. Even unusual circumstances, such as those brought about by the Corona
    have brought with them, do not hold us back. For us at EDEKA Südwest, being in the thick of things
    means
    EDEKA Südwest also means, above all, strong cooperation with our 470 independent retailers and our
    employees.

    six production facilities and administration. For all these people
    we bear responsibility. To ensure that jobs are secure, that the company grows responsibly and that
    grows responsibly and that food is produced transparently, sustainably, in a way that conserves

    From people for people
    This sustainability report is dominated by numbers. Inevitably. Because only in this way
    we can create transparency and comparability. Within our company,
    but also in benchmarking with others. Behind the figures, however, there are
    always people: Farmers, producers, suppliers, employees and trainees,
    merchants, customers - and their families. They all depend on secure and
    fair incomes. Be it in our region, in Germany, Europe or
    anywhere in the world. Everything we do has an impact on other people,
    their living conditions, the environment - and thus also on our common future.

    2025 are to be achieved. The decision-making basis for this includes stu
    diencies such as the Forsa survey, cooperation in committees and topics of
    merchants and employees. In order to weight the topics, a 2020
    Online survey with a part of the stakeholders and managers of the

    the materiality matrix was on the right-hand side.
    The materiality matrix shows the relevance of the topics both for EDEKA
    Südwest as well as for the stakeholder groups. The further to the right and the further

    earth and our society unique.
    Sustainability has many faces. Winfried Schmitz, for example. He has turned his vision of a CO2-neutral

    gender, age, cultural background, sexual orientation, religion, disability or
    disability or ideology.
    Every employee benefits from this appreciation not only every day at their workplace,

    These include mentoring programs, in-house seminars, online coaching and the
    special support for young women. Reconciling family and career
    is becoming an increasingly important component in career planning. The opportunity for
    family-related time off has become established at EDEKA Südwest. The same applies to support
    for reintegration after parental leave. Family Officer

    It is important to us to take a holistic view of the animal, from rearing to transport and

    completely to ""Europe Soya."" Instead of buying certificates, we are relying on real
    feeding. In 2020, we intensified our promotion of Hofglück products, which enabled us to achieve a
    a large increase in volume. In 2021, the Hofglück private label
    will be expanded to include poultry products. The first step toward certified soy is GMO-free.

    animal welfare management standards for cattle and pig slaughtering.

    For hundreds of years, itinerant shepherds have shaped the landscapes of southwestern
    Germany. EDEKA Südwest wants to promote natural and traditional sheep farming
    with domestic lamb programs from Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and Rhineland
    and Rhineland-Palatinate. To this end, we have entered into cooperative agreements with
    regional producer groups: Grassland Spessart Lamb,
    Rhineland-Palatinate lamb and Württemberg lamb. Traditional sheep farming
    also serves to maintain the landscape. For example, in the Swabian Alb,
    where the sheep ensure that the unique heathland areas do not become overgrown.
    In 2020, demand for lamb was exceptionally high, so that the
    delivery capacities of regional producers were not sufficient. At our
    target for regional lamb to account for 25 percent of all lamb sales.
    sales of lamb, we are nevertheless sticking to it. As soon as more

    we save materials or make them recyclable.

    Material saving
    For EDEKA Südwest, the topic of packaging materials is of central

    large amounts of water, energy and chemicals in the production process. The

    packaging. At EDEKA Südwest, the purchasing department or each production plant is responsible for
    saving
    and the sales department is responsible for implementation in the stores.
    When it comes to product and packaging development, we follow the so-called golden path.
    In the first step, we check whether we can do without packaging.
    If this is not possible, we then look at how to use it sensibly. This means that we work
    reducing the amount of packaging material and using renewable raw materials.

    packaging design play an important role. All the important functions
    of the packaging must be maintained, for example for the protection and shelf-life
    of the goods and for informing customers.
    For paper and cardboard, EDEKA Südwest uses FSC® or PEFC certification, which stands for
    which stands for sustainable forest management. For both paper and plastic, we reduce the amount of
    the amount of packaging material required. In addition, we inform
    customers about correct disposal so that raw materials can be recycled.

    packaging made of wood or paper, how we can reduce the packaging or switch to recycled or
    recycled or FSC® material. The flyers of EDEKA Südwest
    are printed exclusively on FSC® or PEFC-certified paper in a climate-neutral manner.
    Important areas for reduction are the packaging material at the
    service counters, in the bakeries, and in the fruit and vegetables area. In the logistics locations
    we have switched completely to recycled paper. At the production sites
    Ortenauer Weinkeller and Schwarzwald- Sprudel are already made from 100 percent recycled paper.
    Sprudel already come 100 percent from certified sources. Almost all packaging
    at EDEKA Südwest Fleisch is FSC® certified. At the bakeries, in 2019
    privatizations also contributed to the decline in paper consumption. Two important
    projects in 2020 were the conversion of stores in the Beverages division to electronic
    invoicing and a change in promotion chain printing, which saves a lot of paper.

    When we set ourselves binding goals, we sometimes achieve them faster than
    planned: In the case of the four goals ""More employee training,"" ""Actively help shape nature
    conservation""
    (""Our Home & Nature"" competition), ""Helping where it is needed"" (food bag
    campaign) and ""Getting children interested in vegetables"" (vegetable beds for kids).
    we have already reached or almost reached the target values for 2025. We have already increased the
    target for ""Reduce
    emissions"" was already increased in 2018. Also in the area of ""Reduce packaging material
    opportunities for change have opened up more quickly,
    than initially foreseeable. We have therefore formulated a new target for 2025.
    The goal of ""increasing organic sales"" is so close to being achieved by 2020 that we have already

    17 Goals

    All member states of the United Nations agreed on the
    September 2015 on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
    It comprises 17 goals for socially, economically, and ecologically
    ecologically sustainable development. Here we show which
    EDEKA Südwest's measures contribute to these goals.
    No poverty The goal is to end poverty in all
    form and everywhere. EDEKA
    Southwest is concerned with the professional
    integration of people with disabilities,
    for example through special
    markets in which they work.
    No hunger In the markets sold

    production operations, as well as monetary donations:

    who are dependent on food in the Tafel
    stores.
    Health and well-being To this
    goal are our nutrition service
    employees, the company health
    health management and our
    commitment to kindergartens and
    schools.
    High quality education Learning for all
    generations are made possible by the projects
    ""Vegetable Beds for Kids"", ""Move More
    - eat better"" and ""Fit for my
    Life"". It is important to us to increase the proportion
    and to recruit skilled workers and
    to win over executives.
    Gender equality By 2025, we have
    We have set ourselves the goal that 30 percent of
    of managers in the first four
    management levels are women. All employees
    have equal opportunities to
