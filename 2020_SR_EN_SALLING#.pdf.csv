           Plastic     must be recycled
           Many Danes consider plastic to be one of the most
           important areas of environmental action. Although
           plastic has a much lower climate impact than for
           example food, plastic is bad for the environment
           and the climate if it is not used and recycled
           properly.
           As a result, we are working to reduce the use of
           unnecessary plastic, while ensuring that as much
           as possible is reused or recycled.
           We launched our plastic ambition in 2019 which
           formed the foundation for our work in 2019 and
           2020.

           retail store
           To solve our shared climate challenge we must
           think outside the box, for example when building
           new stores. That is why we in 2020 have built
           and opened Denmark’s first stand-alone retail
           store with a focus on greater sustainability. In
           December 2020, a new store concept in Bygholm
           Bakker near the town of Horsens was inaugurated
           in collaboration with C.F. Møller Architects. An
           innovative concept with respect for nature, the
           environment and local communities in Bygholm
           Bakker. The concept was also developed with a
           view to creating a more sustainable store with-
           out additional establishment costs.
