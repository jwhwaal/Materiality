strategy has served us well
since 2018 and is still helping
us deliver solid results.
At the same time, the world around us is changing
fast, with consumer sentiment and behavior
shifting and competitors evolving quickly to keep
up. To make sure our strategic framework stays
relevant, this year we simplified, focused and
accelerated some areas. The result is the
updated framework on this page.
You’ll notice a few changes that reconfirm our
direction and drive focus. We articulated a new
vision that defines the dot on the horizon we are
moving towards, which is to create the leading
local food shopping experience. We tightened our
focus to four key growth drivers that are helping
us fulfill our purpose, achieve our vision and
prepare our business for tomorrow. Technology is
now integrated into all the growth drivers – it
enables everything we do. We have incorporated
our business model wheel – through which we
save for our customers, drive same-store sales
and fund growth – into our “strengthen operational
excellence” growth driver.
Our four growth drivers enabled our brands to
respond swiftly to consumers’ evolving needs
during the COVID-19 pandemic and supported
our leading market share positions across our
geographies.
While our promises are no longer visible on the
framework, they have become an integral part of
how we execute our strategy. In other words, they
are part of our DNA. Our values remain
unchanged – they are core to who we are and
how we define our culture.

 Risks and material ESG impacts
 Integrated overview
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
assessment is designed to identify, assess and
plan for the most significant, or “principal” risks to
the achievement of our strategic, operational,
financial and regulatory business objectives. All of
the principal risks identified are considered to
present a material financial risk. The ERM
assessment is integrated with the results of our
ESG materiality assessment, which evaluates
environmental, social and economic trends, and
helps us to identify risk drivers within the principal
risks facing Ahold Delhaize in the short term, and
topics that may evolve and present risks in the
foreseeable future.
The diagram1 to the right provides an overview of
the results of our integrated approach and depicts
how material ESG topics intersect with and feed
into the broader principal risks identified within our
ERM assessment. These topics are considered
by both assessments to have a material impact
on our current business objectives from a ESG
perspective and from a financial perspective. This
is not a static exercise; we closely monitor how
these topics evolve over time, tracking any
emerging ESG and financial risks.
The outcomes of our ERM assessment and ESG
materiality assessment, described in the sections
that follow, serve as key inputs to our annual
strategy setting and risk mitigation processes that
drive the formation of policies, procedures and
controls, the scope of internal audit activities, and
our business planning and performance process.
See How we manage risk for more information
about our Governance, Risk and Compliance
(GRC) Framework, ERM Program and risk
appetite. See Material ESG impacts for details on
the ESG materiality assessment.

Sensitivity analysis
At Ahold Delhaize, we closely follow the impact of different internal
and external risk factors on operations. The purpose of our
sensitivity analysis is to assess these risks in the context of the
Company’s current strategy to determine their impact on our
business and the viability of our business model, as well as on our
ability to meet our financial liabilities and other obligations.
Our strategy is based on assumptions relating to: the global
economic climate, changes in consumer behavior, competitor
actions, market dynamics and our current and planned structure,
among other factors.

environmental, social and economic
concerns. We use their feedback to
determine our material ESG impacts,
which, in turn, inform our Leading
Together strategy.
The overall process we used in the 2020 analysis included three
steps.
• First, we selected the most relevant topics to use as a starting
  point by referencing international reporting standards (including
  the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting
  Standards Board (SASB) and the United Nations Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs)), media research, a peer review, and
  a risk and trend analysis of the food industry.
• Second, we determined the specific relevance of each topic to
  Ahold Delhaize through online surveys and interviews. We
  received input from customers, associates, investors, NGOs,
  suppliers, producers, farmers and governmental organizations.
  We also asked Company management, through an online survey,
  to identify the topics that they believe are most important for
  Ahold Delhaize.
• As a final step, we created a materiality matrix, which was
  discussed and approved in one of the meetings of the Executive
  Committee.
To understand the connections with the principal risks within each
of these material ESG impacts, see the Integrated overview of
material ESG impacts and principal risks.

1 GDP represents the total value at constant prices of final goods and services produced within a country within a specific time period.
COVID-19 has delivered an enormous global financial shock, leading to economic downturns in many
countries. In 2020, we saw a contraction of 3.5% in global real GDP – the deepest decline in decades.                                     2.5
U.S. real GDP contracted by 3.4%, contrasted with a growth of 2.2% in 2019. Meanwhile, European
real GDP decreased by 7.2%, compared to an increase of 1.6% in 2019.

generate their own energy. During 2020, several brands continued to expand their use of energy from
low-carbon-emission sources by procuring it directly from the energy companies supplying energy to
their stores and distribution centers.
As part of store remodeling, the brands implement more environmentally friendly refrigeration systems.
We decreased the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of the refrigerants used in stores further and the
leak rate remained stable. Overall, this had a positive effect on the total carbon-equivalent emissions
over 2020.
Fuel consumption increased to 158 million liters (+6%) in 2020; as sales increased compared to 2019,
more transport was needed to bring products from distribution centers to stores.

 Performance review
 Multiple-year overview
The multiple-year overview is provided for ten years; however, the figures prior to 2018 are not comparable because they have not been restated for the impact of IFRS 16. In addition, it should be noted that
years prior to 2016 only relate to the former Ahold business. The former Delhaize business is included as of July 24, 2016.

We provide four years of data, since, in 2016, the merger between Ahold and Delhaize was finalized. During 2016, all KPIs and targets for Ahold and Delhaize were measured according to a different set of
definitions and scopes, which made these non-comparable. Starting in 2017, all metrics and definitions were aligned and all brands that are part of Ahold Delhaize reported in the same way.

Ongoing education
As part of its ongoing education, the Company organized several deep dives for the Supervisory Board,
held virtually. These deep dives gave the Supervisory Board the opportunity to get acquainted with
senior officers and key talents of the Company and its great local brands and, in turn, gave these
associates exposure to the Supervisory Board. The sessions helped the Supervisory Board to get a
feel for how the Company’s culture was preserved during these challenging times. Among others, the
deep dives included a cyber security update presented by the Company’s Global Information Security
Officer, a presentation by the Global Safety Officer on occupational health and safety, and a workshop
on the background, risks and potential future consequences of the pandemic.
Our new Board members followed a thorough multi-day introduction program, during which they were
introduced to the members of the Executive Committee, key officers at the GSO and Retail Business
Services and a number of leaders of the great local brands.

 Governance
 How we manage risk
Ahold Delhaize has a diverse portfolio of brands,
geographic footprint and business structure. Because of
this, it is critically important that we manage risks in a
proactive and responsible way to ensure we can deliver on
our Leading Together strategy.
Governance, Risk Management and Compliance
Our Governance, Risk Management and Compliance (GRC) Framework is tailored to our structure and
designed to respond to the dynamic needs of our brand-centric business. It gives our management a
transparent view of the risks we take, face and manage and that have a strategic impact on our great
local brands and our global organization.
The GRC Framework consists of global policies and controls as well as a GRC Committee structure at
global and brand levels that serves as a forum for identifying, addressing and monitoring relevant risks
in all corners of our business.
The global GRC Committee is responsible for reviewing Ahold Delhaize’s governance, risk
management and compliance processes. The GRC Committee is chaired by the Chief Legal Officer
and (i) advises the Management Board and Executive Committee on matters concerning the GRC
Framework, including an overall GRC vision and strategy, (ii) oversees activities to develop and
maintain a fit-for-purpose GRC Framework and (iii) engages with Ahold Delhaize’s senior management
on important developments in the context of governance, risk and compliance.
Enterprise Risk Management
Through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which is embedded in the execution of our
strategy, the leadership of each of our brands and global functions review their strategic, operational,
financial and regulatory risks and mitigating actions twice per year. Our Executive Committee performs
a semi-annual review of all the risks reported by the brands and the outcome is aggregated into an
ERM report that is presented to the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as required by the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Ahold Delhaize’s ERM program drives the formation of policies,
procedures and controls, the scope of internal audit activities, and the business planning and
performance process.

 Remuneration
 2020 Remuneration at a glance
The Remuneration Policy of the Management Board aligns the focus of the Management Board with the interests of the Company’s shareholders,
stakeholders, and society at large. A large part of the remuneration of the Management Board is tied to and dependent on the delivery of the Company’s
strategy. Therefore, in years of strong performance, remuneration will be higher than in years of below-target performance.
The Company’s strong performance in 2020 resulted in above-target multipliers for the short- and long-term incentives (150% and 117%, respectively) and,
consequently, higher remuneration than in 2019, when these multipliers were below target (89% and 68%, respectively).

penalized for foreign exchange rate developments, but only for true business performance.
For incentive purposes, we look at operating cash flow to reflect the true business performance of our operations.
In case of unforeseen or unusual circumstances occurring during the performance period that have an impact on the performance of
the incentive plan as assessed at the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board can consider an adjustment, in accordance
with the principles of reasonableness and fairness.

 Total shareholder return (TSR)                      TSR is share price growth plus dividends paid during the performance period.                                  TSR is used to compare the performance of different companies and stocks over time.
                                                                                                                                                                   The relative TSR position reflects the market perception of the overall performance of
                                                                                                                                                                   the Company relative to a reference group.
 Earnings per share growth (EPS)                     Underlying EPS is the underlying income from continuing operations of the Company,                            EPS reflects our focus on growth, measured through revenue growth.
                                                     divided by the weighted average number of shares for the year. The growth is measured
                                                     by dividing the EPS at the end of the performance period by the EPS at the start of the
                                                     performance period.
 Return on capital (RoC)                             RoC is calculated as underlying operating income before depreciation and amortization,                        RoC is used as a measure of how effective we are at turning our investments into profit.
                                                     divided by the annual rolling average of the sum of company-owned property, plant, and
                                                     equipment at purchase price, intangible assets (excluding goodwill) at purchase price,
                                                     operating working capital components, and repayment of lease liabilities divided by 8%.

For incentive purposes, EPS performance is calculated using constant rates to ensure individuals are not rewarded nor penalized for foreign exchange rate developments, but only for true business performance.
In case of unforeseen or unusual circumstances occurring during the performance period that have an impact on the performance of the incentive plan as assessed at the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board may consider an adjustment, in accordance with
the principles of reasonableness and fairness.
With respect to EPS growth specifically, planned or anticipated corporate events occurring during the performance period, including share buybacks, transactions, and M&A activity, that may, positively or negatively, affect EPS performance, are always factored into the
performance targets. In case of a significant unplanned share buyback that was not taken into the budget, an adjustment will be made to ensure that EPS performance for incentive purposes is not positively affected.

Total remuneration
The following table provides an overview of the remuneration costs expensed in 2020 and 2019 per Management Board member. The costs reported here are not in all cases equal to the compensation that was
received by the individual Management Board member. Share-based compensation expense represents the non-cash cost for Ahold Delhaize of performance shares awarded to members of the Management
Board. These costs are recognized over the three-year vesting period of the performance shares in accordance with IFRS 2, “Share-based Payment.” The actual value of the 2017 GRO share grant, as received
in 2020 by each Management Board member, is detailed in the table 2017 GRO share grant (vested in 2020). The actual value of the 2018 GRO share grant that will vest in 2021 is contingent on the share price
at the vesting date of April 15, 2021. The number of performance shares that are expected to vest is detailed in the table 2018 GRO share grant (to vest in 2021).

 Remuneration
 2020 Remuneration continued
Supervisory Board remuneration
The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board in the first quarter of 2020 was determined based on the annual remuneration as adopted by the extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on
March 14, 2016 (99.19% of votes in favor). The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board as of the second quarter of 2020 was determined in line with the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory
Board as adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders on April 8, 2020 (98.76% of votes in favor). Given the nature of the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, remuneration is not tied to the
performance of the Company and, therefore, only comprises fixed remuneration, delivered in cash. In addition to a base fee, members of the Supervisory Board receive committee fees and travel time
compensation contingent upon their activities and responsibilities.

Income tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the
income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or other
comprehensive income. Current tax expense is based on the best estimate of taxable income for the
year, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and
adjustments for current taxes payable (receivable) for prior years. Deferred tax is the tax expected to
be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the
corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are generally recognized for all temporary differences. However, deferred tax liabilities are not
recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is not accounted for
if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income
tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets, including deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforward positions and tax credit
carryforward positions, are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be
available against which temporary differences, unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to allow all or part of
the assets to be recovered.

Goodwill impairment testing                                                                                                           growth was assumed thereafter.
In the 2020 annual goodwill impairment test, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs were based on fair
value less costs of disposal. Except for Food Lion, Hannaford and Delhaize, in the 2019 annual
goodwill impairment test, the recoverable amount of the CGUs were based on value in use.
The disposal of a CGU would require the buyer to assume associated lease liabilities for the stores and
distribution centers, and, therefore, the need to make the contractual lease payments. The fair value
less costs of disposal of the CGU would be the sale price for the CGU including the lease liabilities,
less the costs of disposal. Therefore the cash flow projections used in determining recoverable
amounts included the lease payments. The carrying values of the CGUs tested included their right-of-
use assets. To perform a meaningful comparison, the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities were then
deducted when determining the carrying values of the CGUs tested.

         Accounting policies
Goodwill and impairment of goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred over the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
assumed contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. It is carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying
amount of the investment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs (or groups of CGUs)
that is expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination. Goodwill is allocated to a
CGU (or group of CGUs) representing the lowest level within the Company at which the goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes and is never larger than an operating segment before
aggregation. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint
ventures and associates is assessed for impairment as part of the investment whenever there is an
indication that the investment may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by
which the CGU’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of a CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use. An impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not
reversed in subsequent periods.
On the partial or complete disposal of an operation, the goodwill attributable to that operation is
included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.

operating in the food distribution sector, the Portuguese Competition Authority (AdC) decided to open
several inquiries. Within the scope of these inquiries, it issued, since then, statements of objections for
alleged anti-competitive practices against various suppliers and retailers, including Pingo Doce. Pingo
Doce received eight statements of objections for alleged anti-competitive practices, consisting of price
alignment for certain products. Throughout the course of these investigations, Pingo Doce has fully
cooperated with the authorities.
At the end of 2020, Pingo Doce was notified of decisions issued by the AdC regarding two of the
above-mentioned proceedings, imposing fines on six retailers, including Pingo Doce, and two of their
suppliers. In the case of Pingo Doce, these decisions implied a single fine in the amount of €91 million.
Pingo Doce disagrees with these decisions, which it considers to be completely ungrounded. As such,
Pingo Doce will file the respective appeals before the Portuguese Competition, Regulation and
Supervision Court (“Tribunal da Concorrência, Regulação e Supervisão”). Under the terms of the
applicable law, Pingo Doce also will request suspension of the fine pending the appeal against a
guarantee, to prevent the immediate payment of the fine. Based on the opinion of its legal counsels and
economic advisors, Pingo Doce is fully convinced of the strength and merits of its position. Therefore,
no provision was recognized for this imposed fine in the JMR accounts.
As to the remaining six proceedings, Pingo Doce has already filed four statements of defense, and in
due course, will submit its response to the remaining two, as it considers all statements of objections to
be ungrounded – and will wait for the respective decisions from AdC.
In addition, our JMR joint venture is involved in several tax proceedings initiated by the Portuguese tax
authorities. These tax claims are contested by our JMR joint venture. For these tax claims, JMR issued
several bank guarantees for a total amount of €122 million. Ahold Delhaize’s indirect share of these
JMR-issued guarantees is €60 million, based on our ownership interest.
There are no other significant contingent liabilities or restrictions relating to the Company’s interest in
the joint ventures and associates. The commitments are presented in Note 34.

In Greece, the Company operates an unfunded defined benefit post-employment plan. This plan relates
to retirement benefits prescribed by Greek law, consisting of lump-sum compensation payable in case
of normal retirement or termination of employment. The amount of the indemnity is based on an
employee’s monthly earnings and a multiple depending on the length of service and the status of the
employee. There is no legal requirement to fund these plans with contributions or other plan assets.
Employees participate in the plan once they have completed a minimum service period, which is
generally one year.
In Serbia, the Company has an unfunded defined benefit plan that provides a lump-sum benefit upon
the employee’s retirement, as prescribed by Serbian law. The benefit is based on a fixed multiple of the
higher of the (i) average gross salary of the employee, (ii) average gross salary in the Company or (iii)
average gross salary in the country, each determined at the time the employee retires. There is no legal
requirement to fund these plans with contributions or other plan assets.

        Accounting policies
The net assets and net liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for defined benefit
plans represent the actual surplus or deficit in Ahold Delhaize’s defined benefit plans measured as the
present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets. Any surplus resulting
from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future
contributions to the plan.
Defined benefit obligations are actuarially calculated on the balance sheet date using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using market yields on high-quality corporate bonds (i.e., bonds rated
AA or higher), denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have an average
duration similar to the expected duration of the related pension liabilities.
Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
• Service cost, past service cost, gains and losses on curtailment and settlements
• Net interest expense or income
• Remeasurement

        Accounting policies
Provisions are recognized when (i) the Company has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a
result of past events, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation, and (iii) the amount can be reliably estimated. The amount recognized is the best estimate
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions are discounted whenever the effect of the
time value of money is significant.
The provision for the Company’s self-insurance program is recorded based on claims filed and an
estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The provision includes expenses incurred in the claim
settlement process that can be directly associated with specific claims. Other expenses incurred in the

of such claims is recorded on a discounted basis, utilizing an actuarial method based upon various

Company has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either
commenced or has been announced to those affected by it. Onerous contract provisions are measured
at the amount by which the unavoidable costs to fulfill agreements exceeds the expected benefits from
such agreements.

directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). The fair value of derivative instruments is
measured by using either a market or income approach (mainly present value techniques). Foreign
currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves
derived from quoted interest rates that match the maturity of the contracts. Interest rate swaps are
measured at the present value of expected future cash flows. Expected future cash flows are
discounted by using the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
To the extent that no cash collateral is contractually required, the valuation of Ahold Delhaize’s
derivative instruments is adjusted for the credit risk of the counterparty, called Credit Valuation
Adjustment (CVA), and adjusted for Ahold Delhaize's own credit risk, called Debit Valuation Adjustment
(DVA). The valuation technique for the CVA/DVA calculation is based on relevant observable market
inputs.

Derivative financial instruments
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative
contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each
reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the fair value remeasurement are recognized in the
income statement as fair value gains (losses) on financial instruments, unless the derivative qualifies
and is effective as a hedging instrument in a designated hedging relationship. In order for a derivative
financial instrument to qualify as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes, the Company must
document (i) at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between the hedging instrument and
the hedged item, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various
hedging transactions and (ii) its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of
whether the derivative that is used in the hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in
fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are accounted for
as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash
flow hedges is recognized initially in the cash flow hedging reserve, a separate component of equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into the income statement in the same period in which
the related exposure impacts the income statement. When a cash flow hedge no longer meets the
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in
equity and is recognized when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognized in the income
statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss
existing in equity is immediately recognized in the income statement.
Fair value changes of derivative instruments that qualify for fair value hedge accounting treatment are
recognized in the income statement in the periods in which they arise, together with any changes in fair
value of the hedged asset or liability. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortized in the income
statement over the hedged item’s remaining period to maturity.

• Some variable payment terms include minimum rent clauses.
Variable lease payments that depend on sales are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the
condition that triggers those payments occurs. The overall financial effect of using variable payment
terms is that higher rental costs are incurred by stores with higher sales.
The Company expects the amount of variable rental payments to remain broadly consistent in future

Notes to the parent company            1 Significant accounting policies
                                       Basis of preparation
financial statements                   Ahold Delhaize’s parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Part 9,
                                       Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with subsection 8 of section 362, Book 2 of the Dutch
                                       Civil Code, the recognition and measurement principles applied in these parent company financial
                                       statements are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements (see accounting
                                       policies relating to financial statement captions included in the relevant notes to the consolidated
                                       financial statements and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
                                       Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
                                       Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are measured at net asset value (equity
                                       method of accounting). Net asset value is based on the measurement of assets (including goodwill),
                                       provisions and liabilities, and determination of profit as described in Note 15 to the consolidated
                                       financial statements for investments in joint arrangements and associates. Goodwill is subsumed in the
                                       carrying amount of the net asset value if an investment in a subsidiary is acquired through the
                                       Company’s intermediate subsidiary.

Data considerations and estimates
Carbon emissions data and energy consumption data is collected on a quarterly basis on site level at
each brand. The sources of input data are different, and include invoices, remote meter records, third-
party service provider reports and internal reports. Owners of the input data sit in different departments:
technical, maintenance, intellectual property, logistics, or outsourced service companies. Consolidation
of each of these inputs is done manually. Data is not always available in real time or immediately after
quarter close, and estimates may be calculated based on previously known consumption from
comparable periods or sites that are comparable in size and format.
Carbon footprint methodology and emission factors
The carbon footprint methodology follows the guidelines of the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD)/World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol regarding
corporate greenhouse gas accounting and reporting. Our Ahold Delhaize carbon footprint reporting
historically has covered scope 1, scope 2 and limited scope 3 emissions. In this Report, we separate
scopes 1 and 2 and include estimates for full scope 3 for the first time.
We use the latest available emission factors in our reporting. We source location-based electricity
emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2020 edition; 2018 data) for European
countries and from GHG Protocol 2014 (based on eGrid 2018 values, issued in February 2020 by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) for the United States. The source we use for the market-
based (residual mix) emission factors for our U.S. brands is Green-e, and for our European brands is
the European residual mix.
We source fuel emission factors from GHG Protocol 2014 wherever available, and otherwise from other
appropriate sources. For refrigerant leakages, we apply the GWP for refrigerant blends used in Ahold
Delhaize facilities based on Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Assessment Report data
IPCC, AR5 (2014).

How we performed
Organic products are an important part of the local brands’ assortments. In 2020, the brands worked to
optimize their organic product offerings to meet customer demand. For example, in October 2020,
Mega Image launched the certified organic food own brand, Nature’s Promise, in the Romanian market.
As a result, Mega Image increased total organic sales by €5 million compared to 2019.
Our total sales from free-from or organic own-brand lines increased by 11.6% to a total of
€1,927 million. Even with increases in organic product sales at each brand, the percentage of total food
sales from certified organic products in 2020 did not increase from 2019.
Data considerations and estimates
Data on sales from free-from or organic own-brand lines and national brand organic sales are collected
on a quarterly basis through product information systems. At some brands, manual processes are
required to filter for organic labels.

How we performed
In 2020, the number of injuries that resulted in lost days decreased by 6% to 2.0 injuries per 100 full-
time equivalents. While COVID-19 put additional pressure on our brands, associate health and safety
remained a top priority and we were able to decrease both the rate of lost days due to accidents and
the occupational illness frequency rate.
The safety metric was positively impacted by increased working hours as well as additional measures
put in place to help front-line associates stay healthy. The retail locations reduced the rate of lost work
days due to a strong safety focus and operational changes through the year, including reduced
operating hours (based on local mandates) and temporary closure of some store production
departments. Increased activity and product volume in distribution centers resulted in increased injuries
in some facilities. COVID-19 cases are not included in the reported data and, therefore, did not impact
performance on these metrics.
Our brands continue to prioritize integrating everyday health and safety measures into the workplace.
For example, at Delhaize Belgium, a performance management dashboard has enabled the brand to
take a proactive rather than reactive approach to associate safety.
Occupational illness frequency rate decreased significantly by 0.13 points to 0.04 illnesses per one
million hours worked. The basis for the decline in occupational illnesses is consistent with more
personal protective equipment usage. Many occupational illness exposures can be reduced with the
use of personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves.

How we performed
Although the number of associates increased during 2020 as more associates were hired due to
COVID-19, gender and age diversity remained stable.
In our top leadership, the percentage of female Executive Committee members increased to 25% when
Natalie Knight started as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in early 2020.
The percentage of female Supervisory Board members increased to 40% when Helen Weir joined.
Frank van Zanten also joined the Supervisory Board in 2020 and Jacques de Vaucleroy stepped down.
After Jan Hommen stepped down at the end of 2020, the percentage of female Supervisory Board
members further increased to 44%. For more information on our commitments and targets on diversity

We presented performance against 2020 targets for several other metrics in the ESG statements.
While we did not achieve all of these targets, we experienced challenges on several KPIs due to
COVID-19 and made significant progress on most metrics. In the coming years, we will continue to
monitor progress on our performance in these areas – food safety, social compliance, critical
commodities, food waste, general waste recycling and the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and ozone

Distribution of profit
Articles of Association provisions governing the distribution of profit
The holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share and to participate in the distribution of
dividends and liquidation proceeds. Pursuant to section 39 of the Articles of Association, a dividend will
first be declared out of net income on cumulative preferred shares and cumulative preferred financing
shares. Any net income remaining after reservations deemed necessary by the Supervisory Board, in
consultation with the Management Board, will then be at the disposal of the General Meeting of
Shareholders, who may resolve to distribute it among the common shareholders. The Management
Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, may propose that the General Meeting of
Shareholders make distributions wholly or partly in the form of common shares. Amounts of net income
not paid in the form of dividends will be added to the accumulated deficit. In the financial statements,
the dividend on cumulative preferred financing shares is included in the income statement.
Consequently, net income according to the parent company income statement is fully attributable to
common shareholders.
See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and Note 17 to the parent company financial
statements for more information on the dividend on common shares.
