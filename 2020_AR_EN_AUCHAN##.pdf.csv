                                         : THE AMBITIONS OF THE COMPANIES

  To respond more fully to the new expectations of consumers and citizens, Auchan Retail fundamentally
  transforms its business model and practices by taking into account two major newcomers: phygital and a
  greater focus on eating well and the planet.
  With its corporate project, on the one hand it is about redefining the store’s purpose and operation within
  its living area to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants and, on the other hand, redefining its offer and
  its purpose as a responsible retailer.

To support the implementation of Auchan 2022, Auchan Retail places operational excellence at the heart of the company thanks
to the deployment of the “Renaissance” approach in parallel with its corporate project. In order to restore economic results and
regain room for manoeuvre, Auchan Retail has launched an initiative in all its countries called “Rebirth” which helps to focus the
company’s operations towards operational excellence, to make the company more agile and to free up the resources necessary
for the deployment of its business project. The objective by 2022 is to achieve savings of €1.1 billion per year compared to 2018
      Ceetrus is constantly working, and even more so today, to reinvent its commercial sites and build new neighbourhoods in
      collaboration with local players and partners. The unprecedented situation of the year 2020 shows the need to adapt our lifestyles
      and functioning. Transforming what already exists, creating living zones and fostering human connections is an urgent need for
      which Ceetrus has been working for several months.
      After more than ten years of uninterrupted revenue growth, the health crisis significantly impacted the results of Ceetrus in
      2020. But beyond the results, the period was a source of mobilisation and collective pride. During the crisis, Ceetrus, whose
      identity is based on innovation and solidarity, launched more than 50 initiatives in the service of retailers and residents, deployed
      quickly in France and internationally (pooled “Aushopping drive”, transformation of car parks into cinemas...). Ceetrus has also
      shown solidarity through the effort made on rents and numerous initiatives to support retailers and residents: in France the
      creation of an inter-brand solidarity fund or the opening of solidarity reception areas in shopping centres for women victims of
      domestic violence; in Italy with the renovation of a pavilion at the Sacco Hospital in Milan and the fitting-out of an intensive care
      unit in partnership with the city in less than 60 days; in Romania with the installation of a temporary hospital in partnership with
      Auchan Retail and Leroy Merlin. These initiatives launched during this period reflect the ongoing mobilisation of Ceetrus to
      become a benchmark player in the market, with a renewed vision of the city and Retail, made up of mixed uses and positive
      impact commitment. The teams of Ceetrus took action in this unprecedented crisis. The impacts of our decisions are significant,
      but it was essential to support retailers and partners. Ceetrus remains consistent with its Vision and has demonstrated its capacity
      for resilience and innovation.

The aim is to ensure that the most significant risks are
identified, assessed and addressed using the most effective
methods. A risk is considered to be a potential event, which, if it
occurred, could have a positive or negative impact on the
achievement of Auchan Retail’s objectives.
The general analysis method is based on the following approach:

  gestures (capacity gauge in stores, entry screening, checkout spacing, contactless drive-through or home delivery procedures,
  etc.). With the resumption of the acceleration of the epidemic, Auchan Retail France has drawn on the expertise of the teams of
  the Institut Pasteur de Lille to co-develop a commitment charter to reassure customers and employees. This collaboration
  aims to structure in ten points the steps to be taken to effectively combat the risks of contamination or spread of the
  coronavirus. These ten points cover both barrier and personal protection measures, the monitoring of certain store equipment
  (air conditioning, refrigeration, etc.), and the best practices to be adopted in the production or sale processes of fresh products
  or the implementation of monitoring, regular audit or support structures for the employees concerned.
  This commitment charter provides for a verification of its application and its relevance several times a month and an audit
  carried out, randomly and unexpectedly, by an independent external body every quarter to ensure the continuity of actions
  over the long term. Thanks to these scientific recommendations, which are regularly updated according to the evolution of the
  pandemic and the assistance of an independent control auditor, Auchan Retail has ensured effective health prevention for its
  customers and employees.
  Equivalent processes for recognition by certification bodies or experts have also been implemented in Luxembourg, Romania,
  Spain, Portugal and Taiwan.

      DURING THE COVID-19 HEALTH CRISIS, AUCHAN RETAIL FRANCE IS HAS BEEN TAKING MORE ACTION THAN EVER
      IN FAVOUR OF FOOD BANKS
      The National Collection usually provides food banks with 11% of their annual resources, i.e. 24 million meals. In 2020,
      while demand for food aid is exploding in the regions (+20% to +25%) and while some volunteers, often elderly or in poor health,
      are unable to travel, new forms of donation need to be implemented. This is the meaning of the dematerialised collection
      devised by Auchan Retail to supplement traditional collection. Another way of combining physical and digital for a phygital
      solidarity approach. At the same time, and like every year, Auchan welcomes volunteers from the association to its
      hypermarkets and supermarkets. For three days, in strict compliance with the health protocol established by the association
      and consistent with that implemented in Auchan stores, they invite customers to give them, at the checkouts, products they
      have purchased to donate.

  i.e. a decrease in the total workforce of 1.95%.
  The 5.66% increase in the workforce at Ceetrus can be explained overall by the creation of new jobs linked to changes in
  organisations and new business lines, notably Asset Management, but also by the progress of development projects (Gare du Nord,
  Vigo).
  These new jobs are mainly concentrated in France (Regie Media, project management, Asset, the Gare du Nord project)
  and in Luxembourg (operation of the Cloche d’Or and development).

    COVID-19
   EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY AS A PRIORITY DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS
   In order to protect the health of its employees, Auchan Retail has taken specific measures to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.
   Throughout the crisis, Auchan Retail scrupulously complied with local health protocols and anticipated government decisions
   as much as possible to ensure the protection of its employees and customers: compliance with barrier gestures, making
   available hundreds of millions of items of equipment (gloves, masks, visors, hydro-alcoholic gel, etc.), adaptation of points of
   sale: opening hours, filtering, in-store visits, plexiglas protections, equipment disinfection, etc.
   Each country and its employees have had to show great adaptability and professionalism to face this global health crisis and
   pursue the company’s mission: to feed people.
   Auchan Retail was confronted with this crisis as of January 2020 through its activities (at the time SunArt Retail was still part of
   the Group’s scope) and presence in China (sourcing teams and staff on assignments). The company has ensured their safety,
   by setting guidelines for business travel (restrictions, obligations, etc.), but also by providing advice for employees on site or
   travelling (useful sites, professional advice, and also advice on private travel). A small, multi-disciplinary crisis unit was set up at
   the level of Auchan Retail’s international central services.
   Subsequently, with the spread of the virus and until the global pandemic, each country appointed a “Covid” correspondent and
   set up a local crisis unit (in addition to the one in China, which has been active since the beginning of the crisis in the country).
   In addition, IT teams were called upon everywhere to technically prepare for the general switchover of support services to
   teleworking.
   The Group’s country crisis units' areas of expertise focused on:
   P regulation of international travel:
      − instructions and restrictions on international travel were announced;
   P common instructions specific to the crisis, such as:
      − limiting all business travel in France and raising awareness among employees about their private travel,
      − giving priority to videoconference meetings in order to limit all physical contact;
   P the opportunity given to countries to share their problems and best practices implemented in their respective organisations
      and sites, in particular by the provision of an IT platform (Google Drive) dedicated and adapted to the crisis and common to all
      subsidiaries, allowing:
      − coordination of actions between countries,
      − sharing of best practices (particularly for in-store business continuity),
      − the organised reporting of Covid reports in a specific format.
   In addition to the actions implemented internally for the management of the Covid-19 crisis, Auchan Retail signed a joint
   declaration with UNI Global Union and the Carrefour group in April 2020 on the implementation of best business practices.
   Auchan Retail, Carrefour and UNI then committed to discussing and working together to share the best practices put in place
   to prevent risks related to Covid-19. The objective is to study the implementation of all useful and appropriate measures,
   based on best company practices, to prevent, reduce or eliminate the risk of contagion for employees.
   The measures concerned are broken down into the following themes:
   P improvement of the health and safety rules recommended for each employee in the countries concerned:
      − obstacles and barrier actions put in place for staff,
      − increase in the number of security guards,
      − provision of gloves and masks for staff and of hydro-alcoholic solutions and soap for regular hand washing,
      − increase in routine cleaning and disinfection operations;
   P health rules for stores, drive-throughs, home delivery and logistics warehouses:
      − installation of plexiglas windows at checkouts,
      − regular disinfection of equipment (e.g. scanning guns, screens, keyboards, etc.);
   P social support measures for employees:
      − establishment of a hotline for employees, accessible 7 days a week,
      − organisation of work using “teleworking” for head office employees,
      − volunteering of head office employees to support operating activities (stores, logistics, drive-throughs, etc.);
   P support for employees in special situations (disabled workers, pregnant women).

However, the absenteeism rate is increasing. This is mainly due to the sick leave linked to Covid-19, particularly in France,
where employees were given leave to look after their children during the lockdown period, in accordance with the legal provisions
set by the government.

   and to give meaning to their work.

 Auchan Retail’s ambition is to do its part, as an international distributor, in the fight against global warming and in adapting to it and
 the changes that it implies. This ambition requires measurement of and drastic reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions related
 to our activities, of which the following is a non-exhaustive overview.

  Auchan Retail’s energy consumption per square metre of surface area continued to decline in 2020 thanks to the action plans put
  in place. Energy efficiency in all countries has improved, with efforts to modernise equipment that have been particularly
  successful in Luxembourg and Romania.
  With regard to real estate, Ceetrus saw the partial closure of shopping malls in 2020, due to the health situation, having a strong
  impact on its energy consumption.

     COVID-19
    A REDUCTION DYNAMIC SLOWED BY THE HEALTH CRISIS
    Plastic is essential in the fight against Covid-19 as a barrier material ensuring hygiene and health safety for customers and
    employees. Prevention against the virus has, in fact, slowed down actions to fight plastic pollution: suspension of many
    initiatives (bulk sales, use of customer containers, environmental cleaning operations), slowing of range changes in favour of
    more sustainable alternatives (closure of certain departments) and increased consumption of single-use plastic (gloves, masks
    or bags).
    This health crisis has highlighted the duality between the utility of plastic and the need to move away from the disposable
    model. Auchan Retail must support consumers in their changes of habits while guaranteeing and communicating about the
    health safety of the proposed alternatives.

  (2) Sandblasting is a mechanical process that creates localised abrasion or a colour change on a denim garment. The process consists
       of projecting an abrasive material in the form of granules and powder at very high speed and pressure. Sandblasting can expose workers
       to extreme health risks and may result in the death of workers. Natural sandblasting is particularly problematic as workers inhale crystalline
       silica dust particles during production, which severely damages the respiratory tract.

    CEETRUS, A RESPONSIBLE PLAYER COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS PARTNERS
    DURING THE COVID19 PERIOD
    In order to accompany and support the inhabitants of its territory in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ceetrus has conducted
    initiatives throughout the year; the following are some notable examples:
    Ceetrus France, in a spirit of solidarity and support for tenants, decided to cancel the rents and charges for all shops closed
    during the lockdown period from 15 March to 15 May 2020. Retailers that remained open were offered deferred or staggered
    payments of the rent due during the lockdown period. In other countries, Ceetrus granted reductions in rents and/or charges
    to support tenants.
    Equally keen to help small local businesses and entrepreneurs who make up the diversity of shopping centres, Ceetrus France
    organised an inter-brand solidarity fund so that the major brands in its shopping malls can help the smaller ones. 4 murs,
    Afflelou, Courir, Cultura, Decathlon, Free, La Générale de téléphone, Kiabi, Leroy Merlin, Rituals and Tout Chaud joined forces
    with Ceetrus and supported 95 retailers and craftspeople in difficulty, amounting to €157,000.
    Ceetrus Italy and its partners in the Merlata Sviluppo joint venture enabled the construction and equipment of an intensive care
    unit in the Sacco hospital in Milan in a record time of 60 days. Human resources and the donation of €300 million were
    allocated to renovate more than 1,000 square metres of the intensive care unit in order to create ten rooms for modern
    intensive care and new living spaces for 80 employees (doctors, nurses and professionals in training). Beyond this pandemic,
    this equipment will make it possible to deal with any other health emergency.

   GHG emissions related to refrigerant leakage from our stores         The calculation of the GHG emissions can be summarised as
   are considered to be Scope 1 GHG emissions.                          follows:
   For reasons of simplicity, indirect GHG emissions related to
   energy consumption (electricity + gas) are considered to be
   Scope 2 GHG emissions.
                                                                                 Raw data

   The emission factors used are mainly taken from ADEME’s carbon database and are reviewed each year. The calculation of our
   emissions presented here is therefore carried out using the “location-based” method and not the “market-based” method, as it does
   not take into account our green energy consumption.
   2.7.8          METHODOLOGY USED TO CALCULATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS - SCOPE 3
   For this financial year, Auchan Retail has decided to initiate       2.7.8.2 Methodology used to calculate emissions
   monitoring of its indirect GHG emissions related to certain                         from products sold in stores
  Scope 3 categories. On the basis of a carbon assessment
  carried out in 2019, which enabled us to determine where our          > Scope
   main carbon impacts were, we chose to calculate and publish
   our GHG emissions related to the transport of goods and              The GHG emissions of the products sold in stores take into
   logistics, as well as to the products sold in our stores.            account Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of these products.
   The calculation of the GHG emissions can be summarised as            Organisational scope: products sold in stores may be own-brand

   (1) Sandblasting is a mechanical process that creates localised abrasion or a colour change on a denim garment. The process consists
       of projecting an abrasive material in the form of granules and powder at a very high speed and pressure. Sandblasting can expose workers
       to extreme health risks and may result in the death of workers. Natural sandblasting is particularly problematic as workers inhale crystalline
       silica dust particles during production, which severely damages the respiratory tract.

cooperation fees and includes handling and warehousing costs                   rapidly moving stocks, or at the weighted average unit cost or
directly attributable to the acquisition of the products, and the              at the selling price less the profit margin. Inventories are written
transport costs incurred in bringing the products to the stores.               down if their net realisable value is below cost.

    (1) Auchan Holding has set up several reverse factoring programmes in the main countries where it operates. These programmes consist
        of enabling its suppliers to benefit from early payment options. In the case in point, these programmes are transactions for the sale of trade
        receivables to a financial institution, a partner bank. More specifically, relations between the parties are governed by the signing of two
        completely independent contracts:
        - Auchan Holding signs a framework contract with the partner bank under which it agrees to pay, on the due date set, the pre-approved
        invoices sold by its suppliers to the partner bank. Individual suppliers are free to decide whether or not to sell any one of their invoices;
        - Auchan Holding suppliers may, if they wish, sign a framework contract with the partner bank under which they have the option to sell their
        invoices, before the due date, under terms that take into consideration Auchan Holding’s credit risk;
        - Receivables amounting to €720 million were sold by Auchan Holding suppliers in 2020 under these reverse factoring programmes.
        Outstandings at closing stood at €92 million.
    (2) Commitments to purchase shares made by Auchan Holding and the other consolidated companies to the non-controlling shareholders
        of certain subsidiaries that are fully consolidated or to the Valauchan, Valfrance and Oneyval mutual funds under rules that govern the
        operation of those funds (see Note 8.1.2).
    (3) See Note 6.5 on leases (IFRS 16).
    (4) Prepaid cards mainly comprise the “gift” cards issued in China. These prepayments are held under liabilities in the balance sheet until they are
        used by customers in our stores. In China, these cards may be used in the Group stores without any time restriction. At 31 December 2020,
        the related liability was extinguished, whereas it amounted to €1,538 million at 31 December 2019.

   Certain medium and long-term bank financing facilities (confirmed credit lines not used at 31 December 2020) contain an early
   “callability” clause in the event of non-compliance with the following ratio at the closing date: consolidated net financial
   debt/consolidated EBITDA < 3.5. In the context of its own financing, other ratios must be respected by Ceetrus.
   At 31 December 2020, these ratios were in compliance. After taking into undrawn confirmed credit lines and available cash,
   Auchan Holding considers that projected cash flows from operations are sufficient to cover debt repayments and dividends.
