When the
sea came
to life
FROM HAVSTENSSUND in Bohus
oysters were once shipped to
the Grand Hôtel and the Opera
House in Stockholm. But then
eutrophication led to reduced
fishing and fewer oysters.
That's when Mathias Svensson,
a lifelong fisherman, and his
partner Ulrika Lorensson
decided to do something
about it. Would it be possible
to grow oysters completely
naturally?
   - I saw where it was going.
For me, the environment and
sustainability have always been
important, maybe it will be so in
a small community that relies
on what the sea provides,""
Mathias tells Coop's member
magazine Mer Smak.
   It has taken patience and
creativity to develop a
new technology in which the
entire cultivation process then
takes place naturally in the sea,
without adding food, energy or
antibiotics. In the end, Mathias
and Ulrika succeeded and now
In 2019, they were awarded the
Änglamark Prize, which is given
each year to a company,
organisation or individual that
reflects sustainable food
enjoyment and stands for
valuable contributions to the
Swedish environment and
ecology.
   - Oysters are actually the
best snack in the world, says

               THE NUMBER OF NET SHOPS
            CONVERTED EACH WEEK TO COOP
  The purchase of Netto came as a surprise to the
    industry. Now the stores are being rebranded at a
     rapid pace, in the double sense of the word. Five
    stores a week are being remodelled - in four days.
  One store will close down on Monday to be ready for
   opening on Friday afternoon. Already, Coop can see
   that former customers are continuing to shop - and
      new ones are being added. With the purchase of
    Netto, Coop will have an increased market share
      and a stronger presence, especially in southern
                          Sweden.

                           ""MY COLLEAGUE Karin Lindberg and I
                           stood in the kitchen one evening and
                        rin
                           talked about how we wanted to push
                           sustainable cooking, and we would have
                           evenings where we would serve dishes
                           made from leftover ingredients. Our boss
                           gave us a free hand if we did the rolling
                           ourselves. We contacted the Coop in
                           Orminge, which offered to pick up goods
                           they would otherwise have thrown away.
                           After two rounds, we were able to make
                           eleven dishes for 60 people. Of course it's
                        Su
                           sad that so much is thrown away, but as it
                           is, it feels good to do something with it.
                               The reaction from guests to what we
                           called 'No Waste, Just Taste' was positive.
                           One of them was a publisher and asked me
                           to do a cookbook on food waste. And so it

           ""In conjunction with the 2019 Book Fair,
           we launched the new vi.se. Everything we
           post on the site is now available for reading
           and listening, accessible to all members.
           Basically, it's another way to access the
           journalism we've been doing for over 100
           years. The reason we have been around for
se
           so long is of course that we have been
           constantly evolving, otherwise you can't stay
           relevant. Now we're showing that it's
           possible to tell good stories in more than
           one way.
              Not everything online has to be done at a
           fast pace. On vi.se, there is a calm despite
           being a digital place. We don't post too many
           texts at a time and the site is free of
           advertising and push notifications. Visitors
fin
           should be able to get away from the noise
           for a while.
              For those of us who work with this, the
           change has been inspiring, not least because
           we get to read all the articles ourselves. The
           editorial team now has its own studio and we
           have received professional in-house training

           it's fun to use my voice, not just my pen.
           Reading text aloud also gives me as an
           editor new eyes on the written word; some
           texts are better than I experienced them
           when I read them silently to myself, others

                             By cooking in the shops, we wanted to

               I understand what he meant. As a corporate

            do that now.
               The challenges are many and exciting. We

            Therefore, updating our retail network and
            making it more modern is a key issue.
               In addition, of course, much of the work
            right now is about moving from yellow to

            introduced the rule that if something goes
            in, something else goes out.
               Fortunately, I find it easier to be more
            rational in my work, because the move of
            the KF archives and library from Slussen to

            stores where the signage was absolutely fan-
            tastic, only to find that suddenly an hour
            has passed without me thinking about it.
               For three weeks in October, the move
            took place. The trucks drove back and forth

  From her successful
  journey with
  Systembolaget, Marie
  Nygren takes away,
  among other things,
  the importance of a
  common vision.

   After finishing his studies in economics at
university, it wasn't long before he became a trainee
at KF - or ""trä- nis"" as they were then called. Bringing in
university-educated young people and training them in
the co-operative's systems was unusual, and Marie's
group was attracted by the opportunity to become a
Domus store manager within five years.
   – Wow, I thought. But even as I was on my way to
my first day as a trainee, the headlines were saying
that Domus department stores would be closed.
Instead, we would become store managers.
   The training team quickly realised that having
knowledge of fresh produce is the key to success in the
grocery business.

   Marie Nygren made all the rookie mistakes, but

     Carl-Johan Stålhammar, CEO of Coop
    Gotland, was named Leader of the Year
      at Dagligvarugalan 2019 and was
   nominated for Manager of the 2020Year
          at Chefgalan in February.
The move to vinyl records in the store has been
  appreciated by customers. Therese Ekman

                                                  should be cool. It was he who came up with the idea of selling vinyl records.
Coop in Visby is
going wild
At Shop of the Year, anything
is possible - as long as it
swings and stands out. Carl-
Johan Stålhammar is the CEO
who wants to make Coop cool.
G                   otlanders are good at trading
                    and have been for a long
                    time. As early as the Viking
                    Age, the Gutnian peasants
                    maintained a trading empire
                    stretching from Lon-
donation to Novgorod. Back then, the
hottest commodities were squirrel furs and
beeswax - today it's vinyl records, Gotland
haggis and locally brewed folk beer that sell.
   Among the first things that greet customers
inside the Stora Coop in Visby are all the small
shops in the store: the little bridge house on
the prairie with the people-
beers from microbreweries, or This is
England, where football scarves are
juxtaposed with a concerted version of the
Scottish national dish, haggis with sheep
intestines. Next to the fish section, or Little
Gothenburg, is the vinyl shop.
   - Our vision is to stand out, not fit in, says
Carl-Johan Stålhammar, CEO of Coop
Gotland, who was named Leader of the Year at
the Dagligvarugalan 2019.
   The tactic has obviously worked: in 2018,
sales increased by SEK 43.3 million, or
percent9,3. This was followed up in 2019 with
a sales increase of SEK 17.5 million, or just
over a percent3. This means it has broken
sales records for three years in a row. At the
aforementioned gala, Stora Coop in Visby was
also named Store of the Year.
   Carl-Johan Stålhammar has no
previous background in the grocery trade, but
comes most recently from the job as
managing director of the conference center
Wisby Strand and Kallbadhuset. However, it is
safe to say that he has embraced his new
brand:
on his right buttock he has tattooed

Association President
Coop Kristianstad Blekinge:
1. The net deal, no doubt. It's
fantastic that Coop did the
deal. A brave purchase. It
makes Coop an even bigger
player with the ability to push
prices. A local highlight was
the opening of another store in
Eslöv, which increases our
market share. It has been well
received.
2. The net deal is a challenge
that requires us to work
together. It is also clear that
online will continue to be both
a challenge and a
opportunity. In the future, that's
where we'll find the customers.
A personal sticking point is that
I would like to somehow
reintroduce carry-back, which I
see as one of the pillars of
Coop.

           In my work to help businesses understand the new
         opportunities that technology brings, I'm noticing a
         growing interest in what's called the sharing
         economy. This means using technology to connect
         supply and demand in new ways. Sharing and
         borrowing from each other is something we have
         always done. The difference now is that technology

           But who is using the opportunities of the sharing
         economy today? Well, it's mainly the millennials, the
         generation born from the early 1980s to the mid-
         1990s. According to a study by accounting and
         consulting firm PwC, over 50% of Airbnb and Uber

The operating leases in which the company is lessee relate
mainly to the rental of retail and warehouse premises. The
Group has a large number of leases for shops and other
premises, which differ in terms of their nature, e.g. lease
terms and indexation. Most of the leases can be extended at
the end of the lease period at a rate corresponding to a
market rate. Some leases include a variable fee consisting of a
turnover-based component.

a DESCRIPTION
At each balance sheet date, an assessment is made as to whether
there is any indication that the value of an asset is lower than its
carrying amount. If such an indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is calculated. If it is not possible to calculate
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable
amount is calculated for the entire cash-generating unit to which
the asset belongs. For assets, other than goodwill, that have been
previously impaired, an assessment is made at each balance
sheet date as to whether the impairment can be reversed.
   The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to
sell and value in use. In calculating
The value in use is calculated as the present value of the future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset in its current
operations and when it is disposed of or retired. The discount rate
used reflects market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks associated with the asset. A previous impairment loss is
reversed only if the reasons underlying the calculation of the
recoverable amount at the time of the last impairment loss have
changed.

 The buildings consist of a number of components with
 different periods of use. The main classification is buildings and
 land. No depreciation is charged on the land component, the
 useful life of which is deemed to be indefinite. The buildings
 consist of several components with varying useful lives.
  The following main groups of components have been
  identified and are the basis for depreciation:

Note 29   | Collateral and
contingent liabilities
In some cases, the CF has guaranteed commitments in
subsidiaries for deliveries. In addition, the parent company has
entered into general guarantee commitments towards KF Invest
Förvaltning AB and Med- Mera Bank AB. In the Group, in
connection with the sale of companies, guarantees have been
given to the buyer in respect of the fulfilment of commitments
made.
   In order to secure a small number of pension commitments
made, endowment insurance policies have been taken out and
pledged in favour of pensioners.
   KF, together with its subsidiaries, is a shareholder in PRI
Pensionsgaranti. The partners have a mutual liability which
amounts to a maximum of %2 of the respective company's
pension debt. The parent company has acted as guarantor on
behalf of the subsidiaries and has therefore assumed the
contingent liabilities of all subsidiaries towards PRI
Pensionsgaranti.
