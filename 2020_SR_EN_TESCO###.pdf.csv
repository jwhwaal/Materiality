stakeholders.
Every year we ask our stakeholders and
colleagues about the key issues they
really care about. This process — a
materiality review — helps us identify
and prioritise our most material issues,
and ensures that we are constantly
working towards the right goals in a
fast-changing world.
Our commitment to delivering the
Little Helps Plan, across all four pillars,
is unchanged by this exercise. That’s
because important issues like climate,
packaging, health, human rights and
supporting communities are always
high on our stakeholders’ agenda.                                          Customers                         Colleagues                  Communities                     Shareholders

The big issues.
The world around us continues to change
and shape our business at tremendous
speed. To make a positive contribution,
manage the risks and lead by example we
must prioritise and focus on the key
sustainability issues that are most relevant
to Tesco and our stakeholders. While
COVID-19 has heightened the focus on
certain issues, our Little Helps Plan
continues to help ensure progress during
a year of unprecedented challenges.

People.
People, from those in our supply chain to
the colleagues who serve our customers
and our communities, are at the heart of
what we do.
In a year that has challenged many, our
value to ‘treat people how they want to be
treated’ has never been more important.
We are immensely proud of our dedicated
colleagues, who work tirelessly to ensure
Tesco is a safe place to shop and work,
and somewhere everyone feels welcome.

Everyone’s welcome.
We want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves
at work and are committed to helping everyone be at
their best, celebrating colleagues’ different abilities,
ethnicities, faiths, genders and sexual orientations.
In our annual Every Voice Matters colleague survey,
81% of our colleagues feel they can be themselves at
Tesco. We are determined to become a workplace
where everyone feels welcome.
We have launched an innovative suite of inclusivity
training for all directors, including workshops on
understanding bias, race, intersectionality and privilege.
Our Executive Committee members have all taken part
in a mentoring programme, developed with Arrival
Education, to support diverse young talent from outside
our business. As well as supporting mentees, the
programme aims to give our most senior leaders the
inspiration, insight and skills they need to develop socially
and ethnically diverse talent within Tesco. We will extend
this programme beyond our Executive team in 2021.

Encouraging plant-based diets
Our healthy, sustainable diets strategy aims to help
us achieve our ambition of halving the environmental
impact of the average UK shopping basket.
The shift to a more plant-based diet is key to this. In
September 2020 we became the first UK supermarket
to commit to increasing the sales of plant-based meat
alternatives, setting ourselves the goal of increasing
sales by 300% by 2025. Over the past 12 months, we
have grown such sales by 96% compared with our
2018 baseline.
Today, we have over 350 plant-based meat alternative
products on our shelves, a 167% increase since 2018.
We continue to increase the proportion of lines that are
plant-based. And we are continuing to invest in plant-
based innovation, bringing brands into our incubator
programme and enabling them to benefit from a full
year of support from Tesco’s Product team.

Food waste continued
Helping customers avoid food waste
In the UK, 71% of edible food waste happens in the
home. It is estimated that the average UK household
could save £60 per month by reducing food waste.
During 2020, we rolled out the No Time for Waste
Household Challenge in partnership with environmental
charity Hubbub. This aims to provide customers with
handy tips on planning, storing food correctly and
making the most of leftovers. Six months on, the reset
in customers food waste behaviours is still evident as
83% of households have continued to waste less and
80% were spending less money on food.*
Supporting suppliers
We continue to encourage our suppliers to reduce
food waste in their businesses. To date, 71 suppliers,
collectively responsible for over half of fresh food sales
in the UK and a third of fresh food sales in Ireland, have                                                                                                  Our Booker business is the only

Tackling deforestation.
Forests constitute nearly a third of the world’s land
area, and about 420 million hectares have been lost
through conversion to other land uses since 1990.
We are committed to protecting these precious
habitats and have achieved our target of zero net
deforestation by 2020 through the certification of
our palm oil and soy.
Soy is a key ingredient in animal feed. We know it still
presents a challenge to forest ecosystems and we
have strengthened our soy commitment to ensure
that by 2025 we will source only from whole areas and
regions verified as deforestation-free. Compared to
certification at individual farm level, this approach aims
to transform whole areas of agricultural production
with sustainable land-use planning agreements,
supported by systems that monitor deforestation.

Made Mindfully.
In March 2021 we launched our Made Mindfully
symbol to help customers identify products
that are produced, grown or made in an
environmentally responsible way.
We use third-party lifecycle analysis (LCA)
to evaluate the impacts of the materials we
source. Products that satisfy our sustainability
principles, that ensure a more positive impact
on the environment than their conventional
alternatives, are labelled with the Made
Mindfully symbol.
Currently, over half of our clothing is Made
Mindfully, using responsibly sourced materials
including organic cotton and recycled polyester.
We also apply the Made Mindfully symbol to our
toys, greeting cards and home textiles.

communities we serve.
This work has never been more essential
than over the past year. The impact of
COVID-19 has been devastating for many
individuals, families and groups. It has also
been a challenging time for our charity
partners, who have all faced increasing
demand alongside falling income due to
cancelled events and closed retail shops.

Fundraising.
COVID-19 has presented a huge challenge for our charity
partners, who have all faced increasing demand
alongside falling income due to cancelled events and
closed retail shops.
The pandemic has also had a significant impact on our
normal fundraising activity, with many planned events
needing to be cancelled or changed. Despite this, across
the Group our colleagues and customers collectively
raised more than £20m to support good causes.
During the year, we held two fundraising appeals across
all our UK stores to help raise much-needed funds for
our health charity partners, Cancer Research UK,
British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK. In September,
customers were able to support the appeal by rounding
up their shop to the nearest £1. Customer donations
amounted to nearly £1.5m, with Tesco matching
contributions to bring the total charity donation to
£3m to support our Health Charity Partnership.
