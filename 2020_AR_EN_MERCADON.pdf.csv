2020_AR_EN_MERCADON.pdf,"The Model
Founded in 1977, Mercadona is
a business project in constant
transformation that was built
from the entrepreneurial dream
of its President, Juan Roig: to
promote a company model that
society wants to exist and feel
proud of. To do this, Mercadona
employs the Total Quality Model, a
distinctive corporate culture with
a shared purpose that drives and
promotes a passion for excellence
to satisfy the company’s five
components day in and day out
with the same intensity: ""The
Boss"" (customers), The Employee,
The Supplier, Society and Capital.

     A model with a distinctive
     corporate culture
     Since 1993, Mercadona has had its own company model that is
     responsible for supporting the company's principles and values. This
     management model, the Total Quality Model, aims to satisfy the five
     components of the company in the following order and with the same
     importance: ""The Boss"", as customers are known within the company,
     The Employee, The Supplier, Society and Capital.

     It allows everyone, motivated by their own wish to obtain outstanding
     results, to move in the same direction and decide with agility how to act
     when facing the various circumstances that arise daily.
     As a company that believes in constant transformation and evolution,
     Mercadona is dedicated to respecting the environment in the areas
     and places where it does business, starting right at the top with
     senior leadership and management. Fully committed to saying “yes
     to continuing to care for the planet”, Mercadona promotes respectful
     practices in terms of sustainability and does business in accordance with
     this commitment. The company is aware of the role it plays with respect
     to improving and strengthening the social and economic environment
     in which it is involved, and the company knows that there is still a long
     way to go, which is only achievable through responsible management.

     Materiality and stakeholders
     In 2020, Mercadona assessed the materiality of each aspect of interest with regard to sustainability, translating
     the results into a matrix with a twofold axis. The stakeholders coincide with the five components identified in the
     Total Quality Model (""The Boss"", The Employee, The Supplier, Society and Capital). All of them are significantly
     impacted by the activities, products and services of the company, which seeks to satisfy their needs. Knowing
     their expectations and demands is a fundamental aspect for creating value in the business.
     The process to identify relevant aspects has consisted of three phases: first, detecting and prioritising stakeholders,
     then, defining material aspects, and finally, a step to validate the information to be provided on material aspects.
     As a result, 21 material aspects have been identified and grouped into 8 main categories, which are detailed in the
     following materiality matrix and discussed throughout this Report, with regard to both the management and the
     continuous assessments of the aspects that we carry out:

   Commitments to Sustainable Development Goals
   Mercadona is conscious of its ability, as a company, to contribute to the social development of the areas in which
   it is present. As part of its commitment to creating shared value, since 2011 Mercadona has been a signatory of the
   Global Compact, an initiative through which the United Nations promotes the different Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs).
   For this reason, and within the framework of its sustainable and responsible business model, Mercadona works
   to address the needs set out by those SDGs on which the impact of its activity is strongest through numerous
   actions that, as a whole, contribute to the achievement of these objectives.

   1.2 Guaranteeing safety and supply
   In a year as complex as 2020, marked by the impact of COVID-19,
   Mercadona has focused its efforts mainly on a twofold objective: to
   reinforce safety in facilities through preventive measures to guarantee
   the health of customers and employees; and to ensure the supply at each
   of the chain's supermarkets day in and day out.
   Since last March, Mercadona has worked to incorporate solutions at stores
   to strengthen safety throughout the entire product chain, such as offering
   various disinfection points both at street level entrances and within parking
   garages or the protective screens installed at checkout lines.
   Furthermore, to make spaces more open, thus facilitating physical
   distancing to the greatest extent possible, certain changes have been
   made such as moving the scales in the fruits and vegetables section to
   include them in the tills, or removing tables and chairs in entrances.
   In addition, the company has hand sanitizer, gloves and paper towels
   for the “Bosses” and employees at all of its sites; it has marked physical
   distancing limits with tape; and it has enabled specifically designated
   parking areas for shopping trolleys while customers browse products to
   avoid possible contacts between customers. And, despite the fact that
   the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) confirmed that ""food is not
   a transmission route of COVID-19"", Mercadona, during a year focused on
   increased safety for all ""Bosses"", has voluntarily conducted over 1,400
   analyses on products and surfaces, corroborating the EFSA’s conclusions
   thanks to these efforts.
   Moreover, through collaboration with approved vector control suppliers,
   continuous disinfection has been carried out across all stores, Hives and
   logistics centres.
   Within this novel context, the company has been able to adapt to
   customers’ new needs due to COVID-19, which has led to a change in
   the definition of its assortment, such as offering hygienic face masks for
   adults and children at all its stores, and other products, such as the range
   of 70% alcohol disinfectants for the home and alcohol-based lotions and
   gels for hand cleaning.

   2.3 Leadership for growth
   Mercadona dedicates all necessary resources, both personal and
   material, to promoting the talent and skills of its staff through a model
   that is committed to personal development, one of the company's
   drivers of growth.
   Training and supporting talent
   In 2020, aware that investing in training means supporting employee
   development and leadership, thus investing in transformation and the
   future, Mercadona has continued to invest in training. The company
   allocated more than 75 million euros to training activities, with an
   average of 713 euros spent per person in Spain and 4,835 in Portugal.
   These efforts were undertaken in a year in which many training sessions
   had to be postponed due to the extraordinary situation caused by
   COVID-19. Along these lines, the company adapted several of these
   activities so they could be taught online. This meant that more than
   800,000 euros were invested in audiovisual and videoconferencing
   systems to adapt office meeting rooms and over 1,470 stores.
   Specialisation is also evident in the in-house training that Mercadona
   gives to its managers. In 2020, a total of 201 people, both in Spain and
   Portugal, received training in the Management Leaders programme. The
   company launched this programme in 2009, through which it teaches
   leadership and executive management skills. In 2020, this training
   meant an average investment per manager of 20,472 euros between
   Spain and Portugal.
   Thanks to this effort, more than 2.5 million training hours were offered,
   both general and specific, enabling workers to apply the fundamentals
   of the Mercadona Model, improve their skills and carry out their routine
   work in an efficient and autonomous manner. One clear example of
   the commitment to specialisation is the LIFE Project (Onboarding,
   Training and Development Laboratory), launched in 2020 in the
   purchasing departments. Employees who take part in this project
   receive theoretical training on work processes and tools, as well as
   negotiating skills and the legislation applicable to their routine tasks.
   This learning is combined with hands-on activities, led by a tutor,
   which allows these employees to enhance their skills and expand their
   efficiency and productivity in their jobs.

   and lockers are also shared at the facilities, which
   feature the most advanced technology for being
   able to work as a team, and the site is committed
   to sustainability with eco-efficient measures and
   minimised paper consumption.
   Also, to improve the agility, comfort and efficiency
   of its workforce, the company inaugurated its new
   offices in Portugal this past June, built above the
   supermarket on Avenida Dom João II and which
   is currently home to 150 employees. The three
   floor, 2,500 square metre building has meant
   an investment of 8 million euros and involved
   collaboration with 132 Portuguese SMEs during the
   construction process. In addition, the supermarket
   features a 3,500 square metre landscaped roof.
   For their part, the Mercadona Tech facilities
   located in the city of Valencia were expanded last
   September. Employees can take advantage of
   several types of differentiated spaces depending
   on the kind of activity being conducted, from more
   open areas that enhance interactions between the
   workforce to closed rooms which allow greater
   privacy and concentration.

   Shared growth
   The Mercadona Project involves constant transformation through which
   each link contributes its experience and specialisation to achieve the
   established objectives. In 2020, this joint commitment involved 2,700
   commercial suppliers, over 13,000 non-commercial and service suppliers
   and more than 200 carriers, from which Mercadona’s purchasing volume
   was 21,507 million euros overall, 21,138 million euros in Spain and 369 million
   euros in Portugal. Despite the challenging context, all of these suppliers
   made an extraordinary effort to keep their businesses operational and,
   in doing so, guarantee the daily supply of their network of supermarkets,
   which resulted in creating industry, activity and employment and was a
   driver of shared growth and a boost to local economies.
   To strengthen its assortment and service, and as part of its ongoing
   search for the best option for ""The Boss"", the company has a presence
   in 11 countries in addition to Spain and Portugal. Mercadona has 37
   employees abroad who work with the best suppliers to reach the
   highest quality in the company’s assortment. The efforts made by the
   Asia team in 2020 stand out: a total of 19 employees worked tirelessly
   to obtain protective products that have become essential for “Bosses”
   and employees such as face masks and gloves.
   Code of Good Commercial Practices
   Mercadona adheres to the Code of Good Commercial Practices in Food
   Procurement, a voluntary agreement that is part of the Law on Measures
   to Improve the Functioning of the Food Chain in Spain. This project,
   promoted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)
   in collaboration with different associations across the entire national
   agri-food chain, represents a significant advance in the promotion of
   fair commercial practices.
   Aware of its responsibility as a company, Mercadona promotes fair
   business practices in the food chain as the basis for commercial
   agreements. Likewise, the company has been a signatory to the Code
   of Good Practices in the Agri-food Chain in Portugal since 2019.

   Innovative and sustainable logistics centres
   Mercadona is constantly committed to creating safe work environments
   at its warehouses. The company has been committed for years now
   to eliminating overexertion through innovation and technology, thus
   preventing and reducing the risk of occupational accidents, supporting
   sustainable storage, optimising efficiency and creating skilled jobs.
   To make this a reality, the company launched a cutting-edge project in
   2007, with the inauguration of its first intelligent logistics centre, called
   21st Century Warehouse, in the town of Ciempozuelos (Madrid). This
   fully automated infrastructure, a pioneer in the sector, has proven since
   its start up that, in addition to eliminating overexertion, it is a driver
   of competitiveness and productivity. For this reason, the 21st Century
   Warehouse project has been growing over recent years, and 3 more
   logistics centres featuring these characteristics have been added to
   the list: Villadangos del Páramo (León), Abrera (Barcelona) and Vitoria-
   Gasteiz (Araba/Álava). For their part, the logistics facilities in Guadix
   (Granada), Zaragoza (Zaragoza) and San Isidro (Alicante), they are in the
   final phase of adapting to this warehouse model.
   In 2020, external suppliers and workers who did business at the logistics
   centres have had specific areas in these facilities with services exclusively
   for them such as toilets equipped with daily cleaning and disinfection,
   cafeterias with carry out food and beverage servicee and physical
   measures designed to minimise the risk of contagion, such as perspex
   screens in the receiving and dispatch areas and individual benches for rest.
   Likewise, in order to continue making progress with its commitment to
   sustainability in its logistics processes, the company joined the Lean &
   Green initiative during the financial year, promoted by the AECOC in Spain.
   To make this possible, Mercadona has drawn up an Emissions Reduction
   Action Plan, audited by EY, with which it intends to certify the reduction
   by 20% of the emissions produced in its logistics processes thanks to
   actions that the company has already been applying for years, such using
   gas powered trucks and Bifuel vans. This plan envisages including another
   package of measures aimed at reducing emissions a further 10% in 2023,
   for a total reduction of 30%.
   Mercadona is conscious of the importance of its logistics network to
   guarantee excellent service and the company will continue to strengthen
   and transform its infrastructure throughout 2021, during which time it
   plans to invest more than 240 million euros in infrastructure.

   4.3 Management committed to
   continuing to care for the planet
   For Mercadona, protecting the planet is an undisputable responsibility
   that the company addresses in all its processes. Aware of how much still
   remains to be improved as part of this commitment, the company has
   its own Environmental Management System through which it works to
   reduce the impact of its activity on the environment and make efficient
   use of natural resources.
   Mercadona bases this management model on the Circular Economy,
   which involves sharing, reusing, recycling and renewing materials to
   reduce consumption to the greatest extent possible, create added
   value and extend product life cycles. In fact, the company has been
   part of Circular Economy in Action since 2020, an alliance that
   includes companies and business organisations such as Mercadona
   that demonstrate, through actual and concrete projects, the reality of
   the Circular Economy and its ability to become a driver of national
   reconstruction through a green and circular economy that is committed
   to ecological transition as a general framework for action.
   Likewise, in 2020, the company joined the Lean & Green initiative
   supported by the AECOC in Spain. With the aim of achieving the
   objectives defined at the Paris Climate Change Conference (COP21),
   Mercadona has implemented an Emissions Reduction Action Plan,
   audited by EY, through which the company intends to certify that the
   emissions produced in its logistics processes have been reduced by 20%.
   The Action Plan aims to certify an additional reduction of 10% in 2023,
   reaching a cumulative decrease of 30%.
   Throughout the year, this ongoing effort involved an investment
   of 47 million euros towards environmental protection and implies
   the introduction and implementation of specific initiatives that the
   company groups into three fundamental areas: logistics optimisation
   and sustainable transport, energy efficiency, and waste management,
   including food waste prevention. These efforts hold a prominent
   place in the company's strategies and are already helping to generate
   competitive and sustainable growth within the framework in addition to
   the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) promoted
   by the United Nations (UN).

   Sustainable logistics
   With the overall objective of “transporting more with
   fewer natural resources”, Mercadona has continued
   working for yet another year to reduce total vehicle
   weights by eliminating and reducing items that do
   not add value. This has enabled Mercadona to load
   a tonne more per truck than the market average
   and end the year with an average fill rate of 85%.
   Similarly, the company has continued to take
   advantage of higher capacity vehicles, such as the         Mercadona has
   38 mega-trailers active in the fleet of its transport

   providers, with loads of up to 36 tonnes per trip.

   company has reinforced its commitment to                     21 more than
   sustainable vehicles. Mercadona has a regular                    in 2019
   service fleet of 96 trucks powered by liquefied
   natural gas (LNG) under contract to supply urban
   centres with high pollution; and has 7 trucks
   powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), 2
   more than in 2019. Additionally, the company has
   continued to carry out tests with 100% electric vans
   for home delivery and has made progress with the
   plan to transform diesel vans to dual fuel diesel/
   LPG for the delivery of orders from the Hives and
   for home service in Madrid. At the same time,
   Mercadona has continued to demand the highest
   emissions standards, as shown by the fact that
   99% of its logistics provider's truck fleet is made
   up of engines with Euro VI, Euro VI C and Euro VI
   D standards, currently the most restrictive in terms
   of polluting emissions.
   Among these good logistics practices, the “ex-works
   buying” strategy also stands out, which involves
   going to the supplier's facilities to collect the goods,
   thus improving the use of the fleet and truck loading.
   Another example is the use of inverse logistics
   through what is called the ""Eight Strategy"", in which
   products are transported from suppliers to logistics
   centres and stores, where reusable packaging and
   recyclable materials are then collected and returned
   to the logistics centres for processing. Furthermore,
   the company has continued to expand silent urban
   unloading, from which 777 supermarkets in Spain
   and Portugal now benefit.

UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN, ALFONSO
In May of 2020, Alfonso Roig, the younger brother of Francisco, Amparo, Trinidad, Fernando and Juan, passed
away from natural causes. Through the Roig Alfonso Foundation, Alfonso participated in the Trencadís Project and
collaborated in crafting murals with this broken ceramic technique. For Mercadona, it has been a privilege to be able
to count on his collaboration and enthusiasm throughout all the years during which Alfonso Roig contributed to
strengthening this workforce integration social project and showed that enthusiasm is a value that can be shared,
a key factor for self improvement.

    Proactive management with neighbours
    Respect, dialogue and empathy are the foundations for improving
    relationships with neighbours and the values upon which sound
    coexistence is built. This is how Mercadona sees things, which is why it
    has had the Proactive Neighbourhood Management project in place since
    2014, through which it detects points for improvement and promotes
    solutions that allow it to do business without negatively interfering in
    the daily life of its neighbours.
    As a result of this way of understanding coexistence, the company carries
    out important preventive work year after year. In 2020, for example,
    Mercadona carried out a total of 5,130 voluntary checks of its loading
    and unloading processes in stores, as well as 3,048 checks on internal
    processes across all its facilities. Throughout the year, Mercadona has
    also addressed a total of 586 suggestions, complaints and improvements
    from neighbours both in Spain and in Portugal, 82% of which were
    resolved satisfactorily in less than 30 days.
    Likewise, since its founding, the company has been committed to
    the coexistence of commercial stores and traditional markets, the
    revitalisation of which it has been promoting since 2001. To do this,
    Mercadona has 37 stores at municipal markets in various parts of Spain.
    Moreover, Mercadona offers solutions that improve coexistence and
    strengthen ties with each community. Just one example of this is the
    supermarket located in the Moyúa area, which, with an investment of
    over 5 million euros, has become its largest urban supermarket in Bilbao
    by taking advantage of one of the city’s iconic buildings that previously
    housed the Consulado cinemas. The company preserved the original
    structures, such as the ceilings, floors and balconies.
    Another example is the work done in Porto, specifically, the store
    Mercadona opened last December in the Portuguese civil parish of
    Campanhã. The project that was carried out made it possible to preserve
    the building’s original industrial chimney stack, thus maintaining a
    characteristic symbol of the old industrial area. In addition, the project
    respected and strengthened the development plan that the city council
    had planned for this area, which it intends to rehabilitate in order to
    reactivate the economy.
