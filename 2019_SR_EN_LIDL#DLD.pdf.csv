three years with an annual budget of 100,000 euros.
the ""Soil.Climate"" and ""Soil.Education"" projects of the Bioland Foundation for three years. With
""Soil.Climate""
the Bioland Foundation is scientifically exploring ways to make agriculture more climate-friendly by
more climate-friendly by building up humus. Humus can absorb enormous amounts
of the greenhouse gas CO‚ÇÇ in the soil and thus protect the climate. The soils
become more species-rich, fertile and resilient as a result of more humus. In the ""Soil.Education"" pro
project, the Bioland Foundation uses the funding from Lidl to provide farmers with practical
farmers about the benefits of humus-rich soils for climate protection and biodiversity.
