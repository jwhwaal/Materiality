FISH AND SEAFOOD
The sourcing of fish products complies with S Group’s fish policy, which is mainly
based on fish guides from WWF Finland and WWF Sweden. When required,
information provided by the Natural Resources Institute Finland is applied to the
species in caught in Finland, while information provided by the Marine Conservation
Society is applied to species caught abroad. The basic principle of our fish policy is
to exclude from our product range any fish from fish stocks that are endangered,
vulnerable or subject to overfishing, and the origin of the fish must always be known.
In addition, undersized or protected fish are not accepted in the product selection.
Separate criteria concerning fishing areas or fishing methods have been set for many
fish species, such as prohibition of bottom trawling.
The fish policy is updated every two years, most recently in December 2020.            At the end of the year, the product ranges of our grocery stores included 140
The policy applies to SOK’s procurement and the cooperatives own procurement in        (2019: 134) MSC-certified products. There are 18 S Group grocery stores with

in day-to-day work. The most important thing is to anticipate
changes and their impacts on employees and to genuinely
involve them in developing better ways of working.

                                                            and services. Also, difficult to calculate due to lack of reliable data for different product and service categories.

                                                            This category is not relevant for S Group as it does not lease assets to other companies which would not be included in Scope 1 or Scope 2 inventories.
