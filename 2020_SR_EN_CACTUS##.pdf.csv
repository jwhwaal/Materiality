“Cactus Bësch” covering approximately 50 hectares is the
largest woodland site run by natur&ëmwelt - Fondation
Hëllef fir d’Natur and is located in the north of the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg at Lieler (municipality of Clervaux).
Our financial support has made it possible to manage the site
so that it develops into a natural and indigenous woodland
area. Managing the site in this environmentally friendly way
will help preserve the site’s biodiversity and develop “Cactus
Bësch” into a woodland reserve made up of natural and
semi-natural managed woodland. An educational trail with
learning stations for children, the “Yuppi Léierpad”, has also
been created here.
Cactus Bongert - A Traditional Orchard
Preserving Traditional Varieties
The “Cactus Bongert” orchard at Ettelbruck, on the
Ditgesbaach estate, is part of a national action plan which
natur&ëmwelt – Fondation Hëllef fir d’Natur has developed
to prevent the disappearance of high-stem orchards. In
this traditional orchard, an area of 25 hectares has been
planted with traditional varieties. Later on, stems from
these trees will be grafted and used to preserve and
propagate these ancient varieties. Apart from planting and
maintaining these fruit trees, “Cactus Bongert” is also home   Cactus Beiestäck - Beehives

Cactus and Green Electricity
Since January 1st 2012, we have been using only green
electricity provided by our partner Enovos, Luxembourg’s
main energy supplier. This sends out a strong signal in line
with our ideological values.
All this green energy is produced from a mix of environmentally
friendly renewable energy sources: hydroelectricity, wind and
photovoltaic power. And of course there are guarantees of
origin to certify their source.
                                                                   Cactus La Belle Etoile - South Extension - Energy

Examples of innovative technological solutions we are

Cogeneration: residual heat is recovered and converted
into energy
We try to install cogeneration systems in buildings where this
is technically possible. So for example, at both La Belle Etoile
shopping centre and Cactus Windhof, 485 kW cogeneration
plants are in operation which produce a total of over 3,000,000
kWh of energy per year, not to mention the heat generated
which is used to heat the group’s buildings.

Red Cross, Caritas and Cent Buttek Social
Grocery Stores
As part of their common objective to fight poverty and against
a background where the risk of becoming impoverished in
Luxembourg is continually increasing, the Red Cross and
Caritas Luxembourg have together set up the “social grocery
stores” concept. Social grocery stores provide people who
have fallen on hard times with foodstuffs and everyday
products which they can buy for a third of their market
price. We support them by supplying them with products at
preferential prices.
To guarantee our customers maximum freshness, we
systematically remove items from the dairy section two days
before the use-by date. These products are donated to Cent
Buttek customers.
The Cent Buttek and social grocery stores help people in
Luxembourg who have been hit by financial insecurity. These
people also are given bread, pasteries, fruits and vegetables
that fail to meet our quality criteria but which are nevertheless
still fresh. Fish and meat cannot be donated as they are
ultra-fresh, fragile products (they go to the biomethanation
programme as organic waste). Cent Buttek volunteers come
every day to collect goods from our stores which they then
hand out to needy families through their network.

The coffee we serve exclusively in all our restaurants is certified

3.2 Responsible Fishing
Our commitment to responsible and qualitative
fishing                                                         Iceland
We no longer sell endangered species such as the orange
roughy, shark, grenadier and so on, and we respect minimum
fish size!
We no longer sell “Skrei”, cod from the Barents Sea, which
migrates for the season to spawn in the North of Norway,
because intensive fishing during the reproduction period may
lead to the species becoming extinct.
We refuse to sell living species such as carp and eels; we
condemn any suffering inflicted on animals!
“Small boat” and line fishing
We actively encourage “small boat” fishing, which is inshore
fishing over short periods, which guarantees the freshest fish!
We actively support Icelandic fishermen who use line fishing,
a method of fishing which ensures sustainability of the species
as well as fish of exceptional quality!
