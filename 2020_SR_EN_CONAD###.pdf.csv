                      A strategy that therefore goes well beyond the
                      mere fact of offering food products for sale for
                      quality and convenient shopping. In this context, the

                      in which the dynamics at work in the communities
                      find expression. Each of them is committed
                      To actively participate in the life of the
                      Cooperative, committees, work groups and, when

Thinking ahead:
encourage generational changeover
The generational changeover is a crucial step in the life of a company
because it involves organizational, managerial and often also emotional
aspects. The latter are particularly frequent in the case of family
businesses.
Managing the generational renewal phase of a company means worrying
about the development and future of the whole system and caring about
the health of the stores, which are the main protagonists in the economy
of the territory and witnesses of the authentic values of cooperation in
society. From these premises, a project was born to promote the

corporate cultures, training and testing your
commitment and determination, enriching
yourself with skills, tools and a vision that goes
beyond the reality of your own store. Other

appreciated, which refers to many good practices:
from convenience to the quality of the branded
product, from the initiatives
to the many services that accompany
spending. In a year of largely stagnant
consumption
(+0.2%), the commitment to savings that Conad
Adriatico has succeeded in guaranteeing its
customers is extensive.
Overall, between spending and services, the
benefits for customers amount to millions46 of
euros.
Expenditure
The dynamics of consumption have been
conditioned on the one hand by the economic
crisis triggered by the pandemic and on the
other by travel restrictions (for consumers)
and from forced closures (for shopkeepers).
So the food expenditure in our country,
reports ISTAT, in 2020 fell by 10.1%
compared to the 2019,share billion250
euros.
A result in which to heavily affect was the
collapse of the restaurant industry, with out-of-
home dining seeing a 35% drop year-over-year.
While travel restrictions and closures have led to a
positive trend for household food consumption,
which, according to
a report Ismea, have grown in the 2020
by 7.4% on an annual basis, with a real boom
(+9.3%) in the first half of the year, marked by the
hardest lockdown in the period March-May. We are
facing the highest growth trend in the last decade,
which reached
its peak in March, when sales peaked at +20%.
With the Phase and2 the consequent easing of
restrictions, the beginning of the first warm
weather and the reopening of public venues,
the ""pandemic"" effect actually faded and the
trend in domestic consumption returned to
normal, with some weeks even seeing negative
variations compared with the same period of
the 2019.
The Low and Fixed initiative, to which Conad
gave birth in 2013, provides customers with
many products for everyday use, with a correct
quality/price ratio, representing
a concrete help to Italian families.
700 products representing 128 categories that
generated average savings of 1,500 euros per
year per family at national level. In Conad
Adriatico the savings guaranteed by the
initiative amounted to
to 35.5 million euros (27.1 million in 2019), broken
down as follows: Marche million6,4; Abruzzo
million15,4; Molise million1,6; Puglia million 11,4and
Basilicata thousand710 euros. Customers also

Sustainable building
An objective that today Conad Adriatico sets itself
for the future is to try to minimize the
environmental impact of new stores
in relation to their life cycle. It will therefore create
new buildings with a ""low environmental footprint""
through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,
but also through the search for 100% recyclable
materials and the adoption of new construction
techniques with low water consumption.
The intention is to reduce the use of natural
resources as much as possible. In the new
buildings, large transparent curtain walls have
been created with clear benefits to exploit
natural sunlight to the maximum; the selective
