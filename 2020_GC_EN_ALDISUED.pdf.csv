                                                     FOREWORD
                                                     Dear Reader,
                                                     The ALDI SOUTH Group has always prided itself in making quality products
                                                     available to its customers at the right price. Through our new Corporate
                                                     Responsibility 2030 Vision of “making sustainability affordable to our
                                                     customers”, we will continue to give our customers access to great products,
                                                     while reassuring them of the responsible sourcing of these products.
                                                     Whilst this is an ambitious goal, our new international CR Strategy shows
                                                     that when organisations are faced with global challenges, they need to
                                                     take a global perspective. We focus on four international areas: respecting
                                                     human rights, improving resource efficiency, realising zero carbon and
                                                     being an employer of choice, and combine them with national activities
                                                     to meet our customers’ everyday needs and support local communities.
                                                     In 2017, the ALDI SOUTH Group joined the United Nations Global Compact
                                                     (UNGC) and we continue to be committed to supporting the ten UNGC
                                                     Principles in the key areas of human rights, labour, environment and
                                                     anti-corruption.
                                                     Our 2020 report clearly demonstrates that we are on the right track to
                                                     create positive progress and are implementing necessary measures to
                                                     tackle global challenges. However, there is still much to be done and we
                                                     believe that every day we are setting the stage for long-term success.
                                                     I hope you find this report enjoyable,

                            partners is now in its fifth year. As well as evaluating banana suppliers, we expanded
                            the food CRSE to include pineapple suppliers and are planning a further roll-out to
                            other high-risk food supply chains.
