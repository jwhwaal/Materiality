MENY was the only supermarket chain to take market shares in 2020. In
2020, good infection control, low absence due to illness, skilled managers
and proud employees are what characterised the stores.
For the first time, all the stores were named “Store of the Year”. MENY
also won the Norwegian Customer Barometer for its industry this year.
The chain is preferred for its wide selection and scores the highest in the
industry in terms of service and product knowledge in the NorgesGrup-
pen Kjedetracker [NorgesGruppen Chain Tracker] customer survey. MENY
won the competition for grocery premises in Bjørvika in Oslo in 2020.
MENY is among the winners in 2020 - a year like no other - with strong
overall and comparable growth of 17.5 per cent. MENY’s online sales
increased by 116 per cent and ended up with a turnover of 728 MNOK, a
growth of 400 MNOK from 2019. The meny.no food channel had a record
45 million visitors in 2020. Several stores have been redesigned based
on a new store concept that is modern and offers exciting food concepts
and good shopping experiences.
In the autumn, MENY opened Norway’s northernmost online store via
Eide Handel in Tromsø. MENY ran major advertising campaigns for food
­heritage products throughout the year, and gave 10 per cent directly back
 to the local suppliers from sales in April, corresponding to 10 MNOK. Pro-
 moting a healthier diet has been a common thread in the chain’s ­concept
 development.                                                                                                                                                           Sandra Antonsen

2020 has been a year of unpredictability and changed conditions
for ASKO, with very high grocery sales and a strong decline in the
catering market.
Our role is to help our customers thrive. We have worked hard and
efficiently throughout the value chain to ensure our c­ ustomers
a reliable, robust food supply. A number of measures have been
implemented to ensure a stable supply of goods, and our ­employees
have shown commitment, dedication and a willingness to be
­flexible.
 The delivery rate, which is what ASKO delivers in terms of the
 stores’ product requirements, is now almost 85 per cent, giving
 every grocer efficient and predictable delivery of goods. A renewed
 cooperation model between ASKO and BAMA in 2020 allows better
 use of resources across functions and departments and will result in
 lower development costs and more accurate forecasting. The main
 focus has naturally been on daily operations, but important devel-
 opment projects have also had virtually scheduled progress, includ-
 ing the ongoing establishment of ASKO OSLOFJORD.
 ASKO was awarded the Industry Climate Award 2020 for our efforts
 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our operations.

The Covid-19 pandemic affects
what we put in our shopping baskets
 In 2020, it became apparent that
 closed borders, minimal travel and
 more eating at home affects how
 we shop and what we eat.
k When the pandemic became a reality, it had
immediate consequences for the Norwegian gro-
cery market. Panic set in, and everything from
canned food to yeast and toilet paper disap-
peared from the shelves in record time in the
days around 12 March. Fortunately, within a
short time we were able to reassure Norwegian
consumers. Since then, consumers have been
confident about the safety of shopping in stores
and that there will be enough goods as long as
people shop normally. But even though product
flow has been satisfactory and the entire food
value chain has been working, shopping patterns
and what we buy have changed in the wake of
the pandemic outbreak.

The more widespread the infection, the less often
Norwegians go shopping. In the period after 12
March, the number of times customers went
shopping declined from four to five times a week
to two. In periods with lower levels of infection k

NorgesGruppen is involved in some disputes. Based on the available information, management is of                     No events have occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date that would have a material effect on the
the opinion that these disputes will be solved without any material effect on the financial statements.              financial statements.
NorgesGruppen assess that it is not probable that these disputes would lead to any payments from the
company. Hence, the disputes are assessed as contingent liabilities without any provisions recognized
in the financial statements. The most significant case relates to a notice from the Norwegian Competi-
tion Authority, in relation to the so-called price hunting practices. The remaining disputes are assessed as
immaterial, both standalone and in total.
Notice in relation to the price hunting practices
On 15 December 2020, NorgesGruppen ASA received a notice from the Norwegian Competition Author-
ity (“NCA”) in relation to the so-called price hunting practices. NCA’s preliminary assessment is that Coop,
NorgesGruppen and Rema 1000 have cooperated to give access to each other’s grocery stores with a
view to collect information about shelf prices. In the notice, the NCA has informed that it is considering
imposing a fine of 8 749 900 000 NOK on NorgesGruppen ASA. In management’s opinion, it is not made
probable that NorgesGruppen has participated in a cooperation that is in violation of the Competition
Act § 10. A warning from the Norwegian Competition Authority is a preliminary assessment, and no final
decision is taken by the Authority. NorgesGruppen has until 30 June 2021 to submit its defending reply
to the notice. The NCA will only give its final assessment of the case after the defending reply has been
received.
