   “The food industry has a responsibility to make lasting positive change. By finding ways to
   feed our growing population more sustainably – using less land and fewer natural
   resources – we can tackle climate change, improve the health of the planet and improve
   our own health as well.
   I am pleased to publish Tesco’s support of the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact
   (UNGC) and reaffirm our commitment in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment
   and Anti-corruption in this Communication on Progress.”
                                                              Ken Murphy, Group Chief Executive

Our priority goals.
The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a
blueprint to achieve a better future for all. They are a
collection of 17 global goals, set by the United Nations
General Assembly and contain 169 sub targets to be
achieved by 2030. They address the global challenges
we face and cover social, environment and economic
development issues such as poverty, education,
inequality, climate, water and food crises. The SDGs
provide a focus for how businesses, governments and
civil society can tackle these challenges in order to
promote a more sustainable future for all.
Tesco’s Little Helps Plan helps us to deliver our
purpose of serving shoppers a little better every day.
It’s a core part of our business and focuses on
responding to the global challenges affecting Tesco;
our suppliers, customers, colleagues and other
stakeholders. The SDGs have helped to inform our
thinking about where we can play a role and make the
biggest difference.
Tesco contributes in different ways and to different
degrees to all the SDGs. In line with UN Global
Compact guidance, we have identified which goals are
particularly relevant to us: expectations, risks and
where opportunities for Tesco are greatest, and
where we can make the most significant contribution.

 SDG               Tesco action
                   Sustainable livelihoods for workers and smallholder farmers is one of four themes in our human rights strategy. This recognises that, although our trade provides opportunities and
                   employment, there is still poverty associated with many different products and supply chains. For example, minimum wages may not be enough to meet worker’s basic needs or
                   national infrastructure (e.g. in healthcare) may be insufficient.
                   We are committed to working with workers, trade unions and NGOs in relevant supply chains to identify living wage benchmarks and publish examples of the gaps in prevailing wages.
                   We have increased the visibility of the living wage gap across our banana producers, following their completion of the independent salary matrix. We are now working to agree a long-
                   term plan for closing this gap in collaboration with our suppliers, the World Banana Forum, the IDH Living Wage Steering Committee and the wider industry.
                   We are committed to providing opportunities to help young people develop their employability skills. We continue to offer high-quality work placements to young people. In 2020
                   we supported the UK Government Kickstart scheme, offering six-month work placements to 1,000 young people in areas of high unemployment. Through Job Centre Plus
                   Movement to Work scheme we have offered 618 placements, with 344 becoming colleagues. In addition, during 2020 over 14,000 young people took part in our programme with
                   the Prince’s Trust and the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD), which aims to develop young peoples’ employability and life skills.
                   Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we delivered the Tesco internship experience virtually giving young people the opportunity to work on projects ranging from climate change to
                   sustainable diets. These opportunities enabled interns to develop key employability skills to support their future. We also continued to operate our graduate programmes, welcoming
                   over 60 young people onto our new Business Graduate Programme in the UK. A further 40 young people in their penultimate year at university will join our new Business Diversity
                   Internship in 2021.
                   Our agricultural and manufacturing supply chains depend on access to water for the production of our food and non-food products. It is therefore vital that wherever our
                   products are made, our supply chain operates in a way that safeguards this valuable resource for the future. This stewardship of water resources means using water more
                   efficiently, especially in locations of water scarcity, and protecting water quality.
                   We have analysed a number of our key UK supply chains to understand their exposure to water risk, including their overlap with environmentally sensitive river basins. We are
                   requesting robust on-farm water management plans from our key suppliers, with 40% sharing their plans with us during 2020/21. In addition, we support multiple water
                   stewardship and biodiversity projects in-country. For example, we are working with our suppliers in South Africa to remove invasive tree species along a water course, which is
                   saving approximately 53 million litres of water a year.

    Sustainable innovation supports the Little Helps Plan in all areas. As a business we encourage a culture of innovation so that our business remains at the cutting edge of new trends
    and demands. For example, we have a market leading range of over 350 plant-based meat alternatives to help shoppers eat more sustainably.
    To demonstrate the strength of our focus and the seriousness we place on tackling the climate crisis, at the start of 2021 we launched a €750m sustainability-linked bond based on
    our commitment to reduce GHG emissions. This builds on our sustainable financing strategy which includes a revolving credit facility linked to the achievement of long-term
    environmental targets related to GHG emission reduction, renewable electricity and food waste.
    People are at the heart of what we do and in a year that has challenged many our value to ‘treat people how they want to be treated’ has never been more important. We
    aim for all the jobs we create, directly and through our supply chain to be decent, fair and safe.
    The first pillar of our human rights strategy focuses on identifying living wage and income benchmarks in our supply chain and targeting action in priority areas:
                  •     Tea – collaborating within the industry, through our membership of the Global Tea Coalition, ultimately to close living wage income gaps
                  •     Bananas – Working with all banana producers to overcome the barriers to increasing wages and workers
                  •     Rice – working with suppliers to support the uptake of the Sustainable Rice Standard.
                  •     Cocoa – Improving farmer livelihoods through Retailer Cocoa Collaboration
                  •     Clothing - Collaborating with ACT stakeholders to achieve living wages for workers in the global garment industry through collective bargaining at industry level
    Through our five-stage due diligence framework, wage and payment risks are mitigated and where issues are identified remediation is implemented. Core to this is
    engagement with NGOs, trade unions and other stakeholder groups to help identify areas of greatest risk.
    As members of the Institute of Human Rights and Business Responsible Recruitment Leadership Group, we continue to support the Employer Pays Principle in our high-
    risk supply chain.
    Responding to the rapidly changing circumstances of the pandemic, funding to charities and community groups where severely impacted by a loss of income. In response, we
    adapted our community grants programme to help ensure our support continued for local communities. Overall, we have supported 36,000 community groups with more than
    £85m in grants funding in the UK since 2015. In Republic of Ireland the Tesco Ireland Community Fund programme donated €5m to support 20,000 local community projects
    since 2014 and in Central Europe, our You Choose, We Help scheme, the largest in the region, has reached more than 4,000 community groups since 2016.
    Access to affordable, healthy food has been a challenge for many families throughout the pandemic. In places where we operate, we continue to provide meals to charities
    from our store and distribution centres. We have donated additional £15m of food for communities and food banks with our partners Fareshare and Trussell Trust. In Republic
    of Ireland we supported 291 causes through the Tesco Surplus Donations Programme and raised a total of €146,000 from three separate appeals. In Central Europe we made
    the largest one-off donation to the value of £450,000 to food banks in response to the increased demand for their services
                                                                                       10

    Our Code of Business Conduct, which defines the standards and behaviours expected of colleagues, is a fundamental part of our culture and supports our values. The Code is
    supported by Group policies and mandatory training which includes: anti-bribery and corruption; competition law; data protection; and supplier legislation. In addition,
    ‘Protector Line’, an independent and confidential whistleblowing service, allows colleagues and suppliers to raise concerns regarding misconduct and any breaches of the Code
    of Business Conduct.
    We work in partnership with NGOs, suppliers and the wider industry to progress the Little Helps Plan, contribute to the SDGs and build the resilience and sustainability
    of our business. Examples include our four-year partnership with WWF with the ambition of halving the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket; our work with
    FareShare to reduce food waste and support vulnerable people in communities across the UK; and our health charity partnership with Cancer Research UK, Diabetes UK and
    the British Heart Foundation to deliver our health strategy, to name but a few.
