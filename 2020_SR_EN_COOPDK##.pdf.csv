launched the first public forest,
giving more space to forest and
nature, and implemented the
market's strictest requirements for
pesticide residues in fruit and

   We were proud to be named
Denmark's most sustainable brand
- for the third year in a row. With
the new strategy, our ambition is to
live up to this honour in the years to
come by setting the direction for a
greener and better future - in Coop
and wherever else Danes shop.

Coop naturally complies with applicable tax legislation and
practice. The guiding principle of the tax policy is that Coop
pays the correct tax in the countries in which it operates.
  Coop continuously implements internal measures to
increase transparency and identify risks, and continuously
evaluates its arrangements, processes and controls.
Increased awareness
on responsible tax behaviour
I 2020Coop has intensified its attention to responsible tax
behaviour and focus on creating transparency and
accountability in tax payments and tax reporting. All
guidelines are gathered in a formal tax policy for the Coop
amba- group as part of a larger Tax control framework,
where Coop's tax processes are mapped and documented.
This ensures that Coop has a full overview of risks,
reporting and governance. Coop also uses an automated
screening tool to ensure that potential business partners
and their stakeholders appear on international sanctions

Conversion of Coop
and impact on the wider world
Meeting Coop's own targets does not in
itself restore balance in the global account of
the planet, its natural resources, biodiversity
and climate. Therefore, Coop will also
increase its efforts over the next five years
to bring about positive change in everything
that lies outside Coop's own business and
therefore control. This includes more and
more binding cooperation with suppliers,
producers and knowledge institutions,
increased certification requirements, more
and larger partnerships with interest
organisations and private actors, and
increased political cooperation.
