Migros at a glance
Vision, Mission & Strategy
Migros is recognized by its customers, employees and the public as the leading
company for improving the quality of life. Our vision: Live better every day.
Migros covers the needs of everyday life with its consumer and service products. In doing so, it directs its
offering to all strata of the population and their specific needs for quality of life.
Our strategy
The strategy provides the framework for the orientation of the strategic business areas of Migros
Group. It is drawn up by the General Management on behalf of the MGB Administration and approved by
the latter. The goals, values and management principles are binding for the entire Migros Group.
Migros' strategic business areas and business units act as independently as possible from an entrepreneurial
point of view. They are given clear targets and roles, and potential synergies are exploited.
Strategic initiatives help unlock value-added potential that can only be realized through a
joint, integrating effort.
Our goals
   In Swiss retailing, we aim to remain the undisputed market leader. In the other business
   units, we claim a leading role in the respective market segment.
   In the tradition of Gottlieb Duttweiler, we are committed to providing the best price-
   performance ratio for our customers.
                                      We are committed to the best price-
                                   performance ratio for our clientele.

  It is an advantage for us that we have large parts of the value chain under our own control in the
  Cooperative Retailing business. In this sense, we operate both industrial, logistics and retail businesses
  in the Group.
  The company's own industrial companies fulfill a dual role: the development and production of
  innovative own brands with good Swiss quality at fair prices, and sales to third parties in Switzerland
  and abroad.
  International purchasing makes it possible to procure products at fair prices, taking ethical and
   ecological principles into account.
  We are specifically seeking growth abroad with the intention of thereby also
  strengthening the existing business areas and Migros Group.
  We aim to achieve additional growth through the expansion of digital business models (no-line) and
  the transformation of over-the-counter retail.
  Overall for Migros Group, we are aiming for profitable growth.

    1Unaudited;prior to consolidation of relationships between the two subsectors.
With a share of 85.5%, the largest part of the value added goes to the employees. Personnel expenses
increased by 0.4% compared to the previous year, which is due to the wage increase granted in Migros Group of
between 0.5% and 1.0% as well as to changes in the scope of consolidation - acquisitions and, conversely,
disposals of companies. The Retail and Industry sector employs 105,103 people104'536 (previous year:
105,103).
The services provided as part of the Migros Culture Percentage, a voluntary commitment by Migros in
the areas of culture, society, education, leisure and business, amount to 1.7% (previous year 1.6%) of
value added and thus enable a broad population to access cultural and social services.
Interest of 0.5% was paid to creditors and lenders in the reporting year. The unchanged solid
financial situation of the Group as well as the continuing low interest rate level do not cause any
significant change compared to the previous year.
The public sector receives 10.4% (previous year 13.4%) through contributions to taxes, duties and fees. The
public sector thus received lower contributions compared with the previous year, in particular due to lower
taxes as a result of the adoption of the Federal Law on Tax Reform and AHV Financing of May 19.2019.
By consistently aligning the value chain to the dynamic development of the environment, the Group ensures
the continuation of the company and the progress of innovation. Retaining an adequate profit serves this
objective as well as safeguarding jobs and passing on services to customers in line with market conditions.

Migros in dialogue
As the largest retailer and private employer in Switzerland, Migros is in contact with
numerous stakeholder groups. This exchange helps to identify and respond to social
concerns at an early stage.
For Migros, stakeholder dialog is an important element in the definition of corporate goals and their
implementation. It is an expression of corporate responsibility in practice, an open corporate culture and
a far-sighted approach to social issues. The Generation M website provides information about Migros'
most important memberships and partnerships.
Clients & Customers
Customers are one of Migros' largest stakeholder groups. In the cooperative retail sector, the company
recorded around one million443.5 customer contacts at the checkout in the year under review.
The company maintains a dialog with customers via various channels. For example, via the M-Infoline, where
customers can share their opinions on products or concerns, as well as via the social media channels
Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The M-Infoline was 206'400contacted over 2019times and there were
over 24,000 interactions with social media users. On the Migipedia community platform, customers were
able to have their say on questions12 about the product range and stores in the year under review.
Employees
Migros Group employed a total of employees106'119 in 2019Switzerland and abroad. It also trained 3,700
apprentices in over 50 professions in the retail, industry, logistics and services sectors.
Migros employees benefit from progressive and responsible working conditions, systematic
occupational health management and, with the L- CLA, one of the best collective labor agreements in
Switzerland.
                                                      9

Cooperative members
Migros counted more than 2019million2.2. cooperative members in the ten regional cooperatives. These are
equal co-owners of their regional cooperative.
Members are regularly informed about the latest news in their regions via the Migros media (Migros Magazine,
Migros Magazine, Azione) and the cooperative councils. Migros also reaches a broad readership via its
website.
Business partner
High quality and safety standards are important to Migros. In addition, its products should be produced
under socially acceptable, safe working conditions and come from ecologically sustainable sources. It
works closely with suppliers and manufacturers at home and abroad to implement these requirements. For
example, Migros has been selling chicken 2019meat from Brazilian suppliers that is produced in accordance
with Swiss animal welfare regulations.
Economic policy
Migros actively participates in political dialog on economic, agricultural, consumer, environmental and
nutritional issues. The Economic Policy Directorate represents the interests of Migros Group and consumers
vis-à-vis the authorities, political parties and organizations. In addition, it is committed to the concerns of
consumers and to good framework conditions for Swiss retailers within the framework of the Swiss Retail
Trade Interest Group.
In 2019, Migros committed itself to a counter-proposal to the Corporate Responsibility Initiative and to a
counter-project to the Drinking Water and Pesticides Initiative. Migros believes that both initiatives address
important concerns of the population, but go a bit too far.
Non-governmental organizations
Migros is in regular exchange with numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Its aim is to maintain
an open dialog, to identify at an early stage the issues that concern the organizations, and to incorporate
ideas. In addition, it cooperates with NGOs on projects and topics.
                                                            10

2019 the topics of plastic packaging and products again received a great deal of attention in the
media and from some NGOs. In this context, Migros met with Greenpeace and media representatives
for talks and discussed possible measures to reduce plastic.
Media professionals
As Switzerland's largest retailer, Migros is a sought-after interlocutor for the media. 2019It announced its
annual results at the annual media conference in March26.2018; M-Industry communicated its financial
statements at an annual media breakfast.
In the year under review, the media office of the Federation of Migros Cooperatives (MGB)
received around 7,300 inquiries from media representatives, including on the topics of plastics and
climate change, which are of great concern to the population.
Science
Migros maintains a close exchange with universities, technical colleges and other research institutions. In
2019, for example, it collaborated with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) to investigate
aeration methods for organic basil that can reduce powdery mildew infestation and thus save on
pesticides.
Through the cooperation with the consulting firm FehrAdvice & Partners AG, it was possible to realize a
behavioral economic study that shows which factors influence consumer behavior in the area of plastics.

Sustainability management
Sustainability is part of the Migros culture and an integral component of the
company's activities. Since 2019, Migros Group has been bundling and
managing its sustainability activities in a group-wide strategy framework.
The values of responsibility and credibility are part of the Migros Group strategy. The implementation of the
economic, social and ecological goals takes place along the entire value chain.
Migros Group has a comprehensive understanding of sustainability. It offers a wide range of sustainable
products and services, is a partner for a healthy lifestyle and an exemplary employer, sets standards in
climate protection and resource efficiency, and promotes social interaction.
Mission Statement Sustainability Migros Group
2019 Migros Group has for the first time developed a sustainability mission statement that applies to all
companies. It combines a sustainability vision and mission, group-wide profiling topics, and the Migros
Group Sustainability Requirements (formerly Basic Requirements) under one roof.
The mission statement embeds the sustainability strategies of the business units as well as the
individual sustainability goals of the companies in a Group-wide, overarching framework. It pursues the
vision ""We make life more sustainable"" and focuses on a sustainable product range, climate protection,
closing the loop, and promoting social cohesion.

Group requirements
All Migros Group companies are required to implement a set of minimum social and environmental
requirements, the so-called Migros Group Requirements Sustainability (formerly Basic Requirements). In
the reporting year, the Migros Group Requirements were revised and concretized.
The Migros15 Group requirements for suppliers and assortment include, for example, labor standards in
the supply chain, specifications on animal welfare and the protection of global fish stocks and tropical
forests. There are new requirements for operational environmental protection in the supply chain, a peat ban,
and a fur and mulesing ban. In the latter, the skin of Merino sheep is removed around the tail without the
use of painkillers.
                                                       13

The Migros Group requirements for operational environmental protection include active and risk-based
management of waste, electricity, heat and refrigerants. In addition, all companies must offset their business
flights, travel by public transport as a matter of priority, and comply with procurement principles on climate-
friendly passenger vehicles.
Cooperative retail trade
Migros successfully completed the two pledges ""WWF environmental education"" and ""Free starts for
children at running events"" in 2019. The pledges originate from the Generation M sustainability program, with
which the cooperative retail trade transparently communicates concrete and measurable sustainability goals.
Generation M is part of the long-term sustainability strategy of the Cooperative Retail Trade, which was
revised in the reporting year in coordination with the Migros Group sustainability mission statement.
Individual sustainability targets were defined in this context. Measures are to continue to be taken to achieve
ecological and social improvements in as many products as possible. To this end, Migros has analyzed the
negative impact of the most important raw materials across the entire value chain and, on this basis,
defined requirements for cultivation and processing. In addition, the topics of climate protection, water,
biodiversity, and closing the loop are to be increasingly addressed.
M-Industry
In the reporting year, the Group certificate for M-Industry's sustainability management in accordance with
ISO 14001 was confirmed. The uniform management and control system enables M-Industry to work
systematically to optimize sustainability performance, minimize environmental impact and comply with
environmental legislation requirements.
2019 eight sites achieved initial ISO certification This14001. brings the total number of M-Industry companies
certified to 201919 at the end of the year. The ISO 14001 certification of all companies up to is part 2020of

economy and society.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the2015 UN include targets 17as a framework for
global sustainable development. With its commitment, Migros Group makes an important contribution to
the implementation of these global sustainability goals along the entire value chain.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been incorporated into the development of the Migros
Group sustainability mission statement. Comprehensive information on Migros Group's contribution
to the SDGs can be found here.

sustainability by means of strategic key figures. As part of regular controlling, the implementation status
of the Migros Group requirements and the individual goals in the strategic business areas is reviewed

reported to internal decision-makers and in some cases published publicly.
