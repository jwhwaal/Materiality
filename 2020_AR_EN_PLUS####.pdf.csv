Gross sales result
Gross sales result increased on balance by € million14,7 to € million223,6. The increase in the gross sales
result due to higher sales was partly offset by a slight decrease in the relative margin. The gross sales
result as a percentage of net sales amounted to 10.1% compared with 10.6% in The2019. decrease in this
percentage is mainly due to the fact that part of the supplier contributions did not vary with the increased
sales. In addition, the relative decrease is related to higher logistics costs included as part of the gross
sales result. The increase in logistics costs relates both to the costs associated with start-up costs for
the new distribution center in Oss and to relatively higher sales of fresh products.
Operating EBITDA
Operating EBITDA (gross sales income minus expenses excluding depreciation) increased from
€ million 90,0in to2019 € million108,3 in This 2020.increase is mainly related to the higher gross sales
result of € million14,7 due to higher merchandise sales and € million 3,6lower costs (excluding
depreciation).
Earnings before purchase discounts and taxes
The result before purchase discounts and taxes increased in by 202031.1% or by € million18,6 to €78.5

147,2comparison to € million150,3 in a 2019,decrease of € 1.5 million.

offset by higher personnel costs, as a result of a higher workforce and salary increases. An amount of €
million was also 2,3added to the reorganization provision in connection with the planned merger of the
distribution centers into a single mechanized distribution center in Oss.
Purchase discounts

2.0% of the turnover of goods to 2019,the PLUS entrepreneurs for the year as2020, well as for the year
2005. It is also proposed to pay an 2020additional purchase discount of 0.5% for the transition to electronic

       Pork from own closed short chain
       In 2019PLUS entered into a unique partnership
       with Vion Food Group and sixteen Dutch pig
       farmers. In 2020we expanded this cooperation
       further.
       This gives us insight into the origin of our fresh
       pork and meat products with the Beter Leven 1-
       star quality mark. This private, transparent
       and closed short chain supplies fresh pork and
       meat products to our supermarkets. We have
       given the chain approach plenty of attention,
       including talks with the Ministry of Agriculture,
       Nature and Food Quality.
       The story behind our products
       By 2020, we informed our customers about the
       exact origin of our Fairtrade and climate-neutral
       bananas in our magazine, in the weekly leaflet and
       in our stores. We recorded every step in the
       banana chain with blockchain.
       With the code on the Fairtrade sticker,
       customers can follow the journey of the banana at
       www.plus.nl/info-herkomst-bananen. From the
       plantation in Colombia to the shopping basket.
       During the PlanetProof week we informed our
       customers about PlanetProof in our brochure and
       magazine to make them aware of the added value
       of the label.

What were the most important themes
for the supervisory board in 2020? ""We
discussed many different themes as a board,
including automation, e-com- merce, the new
distribution center in Oss, the introduction of
electronic shelf labels and the new condition
system. In terms of automation, a solid
foundation has been laid for the future in 2020.
The Board is also positive about the start of the
construction of a new distribution center in Oss.

it is finished. We also decided positively on the
investment in electronic shelf labels, which
offer both entrepreneur and customer a lot of
extra convenience.
We also talked further about the condition
system, which we hope to have final agreements
on in 2021. The reassessment of the condition
system is very much alive within the cooperative,
but it is complex. Nevertheless, we managed to
make a lot2020 of progress on this issue. The

in the further elaboration. The condition system is
very important for the cooperative and its
entrepreneurs because it goes to the heart of
entrepreneurship: the costs and benefits. The
main board expects that we will be able to

first half of this year. Looking at the outlines, the
new system is more transparent and thus provides
more clarity for every entrepreneur. We look
forward to a successful conclusion of this important
issue in2021 . ""
What other activities has the main
board been involved with over the
past year?
""There were 2020several other important
issues on the agenda.
For example, we paid a great deal of attention to
contacts with entrepreneurs via the Cluster
Council and the Coordination Teams. We continue
to work continuously to optimize mutual
communication, including through a tough
administrative training course for entrepreneurs
who are or want to become active in the
cooperative. This is done
in collaboration with the Erasmus University
Rotterdam. We see that in the Cluster Council
and the Coordination Teams there is a great need
to catch up often, also outside the regular
meetings.
The main board encourages and appreciates
this. Furthermore, e-commerce was high on
the agenda. This activity grew very rapidly in
2020 and this placed challenges on
entrepreneurs in terms of logistics and
profitability.
E-commerce requires maximum efficiency within
the choices made. In this regard, the main board
has consulted intensively with the management

The success of a cooperative stands or falls with the active
commitment of its members. At PLUS, the Cluster Council

ensure the intensive interaction between all stakeholders

As part of a legal restructuring of PLUS Holding in 2004, the preferred shares held by entrepreneurs in
the capital of PLUS companies in which the distribution centers were housed were redeemed. Instead,
the Entrepreneurs' Cooperative De Sperwer U.A. issued to PLUS entrepreneurs participations with a nominal

consolidated cash
flow statement
The cash flow statement has been prepared
using the indirect method. The cash and cash
equivalents included in the cash flow statement
are freely available. Receipts and expenditure on
account of interest, dividends received and profit
tax have been included in the cash flow from
operating activities. Purchase discounts paid are
also included in the cash flow from operating
activities.
The acquisition price of an acquired group company
and the selling price of a sold group company are
included in the cash flow from investment
activities, insofar as payment in cash has taken
place. The cash present in these group companies
is deducted from the purchase or selling price, as
appropriate.
Investments in intangible assets and property,
plant and equipment are recorded at the
amounts paid. This means that end-of-year
investment liabilities recognized in the balance
sheet are eliminated in the statement of cash
flows.

Business premises include distribution centers and retail premises leased to entrepreneurs. The
distribution centers and store premises are intended to operate a supermarket, contribute to the
primary business objective of PLUS and are therefore accounted for as tangible fixed assets and not as
investment property. The current value of the combined business
buildings and land amounts to approximately € million200,9 (2019: € million203,1). Here, the current value of
the distribution centers is based on the externally appraised private sale value and the current value of the
retail properties on the capitalized rental income.
Commercial buildings and construction equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over ten to
thirty years. Other fixed operating assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over three to ten
years.
The properties earmarked for sale of € 0.5 million relate to retail properties and industrial sites that
are no longer intended for the establishment of a PLUS supermarket but to be disposed of to third
parties.
Assets under construction and properties held for sale are not depreciated.

Risk Management
In the normal course of business, PLUS Holding is exposed to investment risk, credit risk and liquidity
risk.
Investment Risks
The risks with regard to investments in the area of store locations and real estate must be carefully
weighed. PLUS carries out thorough analyses with regard to the stores and real estate and has drawn up
plans for the future. There is a central multidisciplinary investment committee which checks all major
investment proposals in advance to limit and control risks. Investments above a certain amount must
also be approved by the Supervisory Board.
Investments are never completely without risk. For this reason PLUS Holding considers this a medium
risk given the measures that have been taken. If a risk does occur, the impact depends on the size of
the investment involved. On average, the impact and residual risk are considered medium.
Credit risk
The credit risk incurred by PLUS Holding is closely linked to the financial position of its affiliated
entrepreneurs. Credit risk is not limited only to outstanding trade receivables, but also includes the
financing of affiliated entrepreneurs. In addition, PLUS Holding is a guarantor in specific situations for
financing provided by banks to entrepreneurs. The collateral to be provided to the bank - often in the form
of guarantees - is offset by the collateral to be provided to PLUS Holding by the entrepreneurs. The total
credit risk is controlled by intensive monitoring and surveillance of the financial position of the stores.
The profitability and viability of the stores are also continually assessed. Where appropriate,
unprofitable outlets are divested. PLUS believes that sufficient measures are in place to manage this
risk. The likelihood of this risk occurring depends in part on the situation in the stores. The impact on the
results and financial position depends on the financial position of the stores and can therefore vary and
is classified by PLUS as medium. The residual risk is also classified as medium.
Liquidity risk
Continuous monitoring of future credit requirements in relation to available credit facilities ensures that
sufficient liquidity is always available to enable PLUS Holding to meet its financial obligations at all
times. Since PLUS Holding does not run any currency risks and there are limited interest rate risks,
there is little or no impact on the (future) cash flows in this regard. The impact and residual risk are
therefore classified as low.

A summary of the off-balance sheet arrangements as of the balance sheet date is as follows:

fulfilment of obligations to third parties, guarantees to the amount of € million0,1 (2019: € million0,1) have
been provided by the bank, at the expense and risk of PLUS Holding.
Purchasing contracts
In addition to the aforementioned obligations, at year-end and2020 purchase contracts2019 have been
entered into for the supply of goods and services that are reasonably related to normal business operations.
Store Takeover Duty
PLUS has made an agreement with some of its entrepreneurs that if they offer their store to PLUS for
sale, PLUS is obliged to purchase this store operation. For these stores, PLUS has the obligation to
purchase the store at a pre-agreed arrangement. This is usually on the basis of a percentage of the DCF
value of the store or on the basis of a firm agreement, possibly including taking over the rental contract.
These stores are in principle resold by PLUS to another entrepreneur at the same value.
Preferential right to buy stores
PLUS has agreed with some of the entrepreneurs who own a storefront to exercise the first right of
purchase in case the entrepreneur stops his operation and wishes to sell it.
