  In 2019, we initiated extensive work to identify the products in each division that are
  sustainable from a climate perspective. We defined sustainable products as those
  which have a significantly smaller climate impact than comparable products or which
  are important for adapting to climate change. Our next goal is to report and monitor
  the sales of sustainable products.

TRACE THE ORIGIN
OF PRODUCTS
Companies are expected to provide even more
open information on where their products
come from, how working conditions at factories
and premises are monitored, and how the
environmental impact of products is minimised.
To improve transparency in our supply chains, we launched
the Tracing Our Products website in autumn 2020, where we
provide information on the origin of products and their journey
to the shelves of K-stores.
The website initially provides information on the origin of all
Pirkka and K-Menu tuna and Pirkka Fairtrade roses and their
journey to the shelves of K-stores. Of Finnish products, we first
provide information on the journey of PROF Timber products
from the forest to sawmills and then on to K-Rauta stores. We
aim to add information to the website on products that our
customers and stakeholders are particularly interested in.
The products on the Tracing Our Products website are
K Group’s own brand products. We will select products that
face challenges regarding the sustainable production of raw
materials and whose purchasing is steered by K Group’s
sustainability policies.

CARBON NEUTRAL GROCERY STORES
In 2019, K Group, together with Natural Resources Institute
Finland (Luke), developed a model which enables a grocery
store to become carbon neutral. The model has been
piloted in three K-food stores. Based on their experiences,
the aim is to expand the model to other K-food stores.
The carbon neutral store operating model defines the
carbon footprint of the store’s own activities and its
footprint reduction target. The aim is to identify and
implement actions to reduce the carbon footprint of the
store and then calculate the necessary amount of offsets.
Our goal is that stores will have less and less need for
offsets in the future.
CARBON FOOTPRINT CALCULATOR
IN THE K-OSTOKSET SERVICE
Our data-based K-Ostokset service allows users to track
how much Finnish food they are buying and has a carbon
footprint calculator, which provides information on the
carbon footprint of a customer’s shopping basket at
the product category level. The service’s new Nutrition
section allows customers to monitor their consumption of
sugar, salt, red meat, fish and vegetables. This way they
can compare their own data with the national nutrition
recommendations and set goals for their consumption.

Emission reductions of products for sale
By far, the greatest indirect emissions of Kesko are caused
in the production of the products for sale and during their
use phase. These emissions can be mitigated by offering
selections of products and services causing less emissions
and by means of customer communications.
We have identified sustainable products for each division
and we promote their sales.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF FOOD CHOICES
Households can decrease the environmental impact of their
food choices by reducing the consumption of animal-based
products and food waste created at home.
We help our customers decrease the carbon footprint of
their shopping. In the K-Ostokset application we offer a
carbon footprint calculator, which provides information on
the carbon footprint of the customer’s shopping basket at
product category level.
We offer a wide selection of plant-based products
and encourage our customers to increase the use of
vegetables.

The building and technical trade offers consumers and
business customers diverse product selections and

As a retail sector operator, it is clear for K Group that
our biodiversity work focuses on our selections as well as
our own operations. One of the main goals of K Group’s
biodiversity work is to build our selections in such a way
that products and their packaging burden biodiversity as
little as possible throughout their life cycles.
We observe our sustainability policies for sourcing to
prevent causing risks to biodiversity in our supply chains.
Raw materials critical to biodiversity in our supply chain
include fish and shellfish, timber, palm oil, soy, cocoa and
cotton. Cotton production consumes a lot of water, for
example. The spreading of production of palm oil and soy to
new areas causes deforestation and a threat to biodiversity.
