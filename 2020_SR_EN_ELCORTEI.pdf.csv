STATEMENT
2020-2021

Everyone’s
hard work
At the beginning of 2020, nobody could have imagined that just
two-and-a-half months later, the country, the whole world, would
grind to a halt. It was a tough time for everyone. And for the us, the
most difficult year in our history. The crisis and its consequences
also presented us with an opportunity to demonstrate our ability
to serve society, the motivation that moves us forward and the
effort we put in to the most challenging tasks.
The report that follows pays tribute to the effort, resilience and
commitment we were able to draw on when it was needed the
most. A tribute to the ability to turn challenges into opportunities.
A tribute to what makes it all possible: teamwork, everyone’s hard
work.

                                                                                         3

Chairwoman’s
letter
This Non-Financial Statement, which I am delighted to introduce, is an account of a period that
required an extraordinary effort, a vast amount of talent, innovation capacity and effectiveness
in our tireless quest for excellence. Happily, today we can talk about new times, reached after
much hard work. This, has allowed us to lay the foundations for the company’s future, a future
of broad horizons in which our customers and society will find a major business group at the
service of citizens, replete with new propositions with a forward-looking horizon.
In this context of ongoing transformation, El Corte Inglés managed to surmount the most
challenging year of its more than 80 years of history. We turned a crisis into an opportunity
for undertaking far-reaching reforms and providing fresh impetus to our various business
lines. And we did so remaining true to our steadfast identity and hallmark values, those on
which we have built up mutual trust with society.
In this new scenario of hope, projects and long-term vision, we have drawn up an ambitious
business plan articulated around three cornerstones: digitalisation, diversification and
sustainability, all of which customer-centric.
On the digitalisation front, it is fair to say that El Corte Inglés has taken decisive steps in
its omnichannel strategy. We have become a fully digital company that provides solutions -
through a broad spectrum of possibilities - to increasingly versatile customers, who can choose
the channel that best suits their needs at any given time.
We launched a new app that gives users access to millions of products and services across all
our business areas. That development effort continues full speed ahead with lots of new ideas,
spurred on by our strengths. This technological transformation, which will soon make the

   The Group prioritised customer service and its commitments to its suppliers and employees
   over profitability, a decision that had the corresponding impact on EBITDA, which neverthe-
   less amounted to €141.73 million.
   EBIT (before non-recurring provisions) was a negative €466.7 million. In line with prudent
   accounting criteria, the Group recognised €2.5 billion of provisions in 2020, including fixed
   asset, inventory and tax asset impairment charges and provisions related with the workforce
   restructuring plans. As a result, the Group reported a net loss of €2.95 billion.
   In parallel, the Group reinforced its liquidity which stood at €3.55 billion at year-end, ena-
   bling the firm to service all of its obligations without incident or delay.

   •   On the employment front, in March 2020, El Corte Inglés presented the paperwork requi-
       red to avail of the furlough scheme set up by the government via Royal Decree 463/2020
       (14 March 2020), declaring the state of alarm. Until June, the company, which availed of
       the measure due to force majeure, topped up the contributions made by the state so that its
       employees received their full salaries. Over the course of the year other furlough schemes
       were implemented in line with the measures and restrictions imposed at the regional level.
       Subsequent to year-end, due to the duration of the pandemic and its consequences, the
       Group reached a unanimous agreement with its unions (CCOO, Fasga, Fetico and UGT)
       for the rollout of a - voluntary - workforce restructuring plan.
   •   On the financial front, in April 2020, El Corte Inglés entered into a new €1.34 billion
       financing agreement with a pool of 14 Spanish and international banks. That facility com-
       plemented the agreement previously entered into on 26 February 2020, raising €2 billion.
       In July 2020, it entered into another agreement, raising up to €974.9 million, secured by
       Spain’s official credit institute, ICO. Moreover, the Group was able to transfer part of the
       credit facility arranged on 1 April to that new state-backed agreement. As a result, the
       Group locked in liquidity for more than one year without having to provide any collateral.
       The banks that did not participate in the ICO loan stayed on in the revolving credit facility,
       due April 2021.
       In addition, the company placed €600 million of senior notes on the market at the end
       of September 2020. Strong demand for the issue, which was four times oversubscribed,             The chief executives of El Corte Inglés, Víctor del Pozo, and the MásMóvil Group,

       prompted the company to increase the original size from €400 million to €600 million.
       The notes mature in March 2024.
   •   Turning to the corporate arena, it is important to note the merger of Sfera into
       El Corte Inglés, a deal designed to enhance the customer proposition. The transaction ex-
       tended the corporate restructuring thrust embarked on in 2017 with the merger of Hi-
       percor, followed in 2018 by the merger of Bricor, measures designed to unlock synergies
       between the various formats and eke out efficiency and margin gains. Elsewhere, SICOR
       was set up under the umbrella of the Group’s business diversification strategy: the new
       group encompasses a range of business activities from home security and alarms to facility
       maintenance and logistics management, among many others.

   RETAIL BUSINESSES
   The keystone of the El Corte Inglés Group – a leading name in the distribution industry – is the
   retail business. Our retail strategy for the future navigates the interrelationship between the
   physical and online worlds. All the Group’s formats - department stores in Spain and Portugal,
   Hipercor hypermarkets, Supercor supermarkets, Bricor home-improvement stores and Sfera
   fashion stores - are interconnected and moving towards an increasingly digital omnichannel
   model.
   2020 proved a challenging year in which the online business grew even faster. In the wake of
   the nationwide lockdown introduced by Royal Decree 463/2020 of 14 March 2020, declaring
   a national state of emergency, El Corte Inglés set in motion special measures to provide cus-
   tomers with reliable service and meet the spike in demand for online purchases. Our stores –
   and the food and essential service areas especially – became platforms capable of meeting the
   needs of the public at a particularly difficult time. During the lockdown, home deliveries in-
   creased sixfold, and we rolled out a range of omnichannel services. We were able to successfu-
   lly meet public demand thanks to the fine-meshed physical reach of the El Corte Inglés Group.
   Since the onset of the pandemic, all Group stores and shops introduced strict safety, signage
   and hygiene protocols so as to operate as safely and reliably as possible and assure both custo-
   mers and employees that the right sanitary measures were in place.
   In 2020, Capital Finance International (CFI) magazine awarded a prize to El Corte Inglés as
   Spain’s best retailer in the field of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) performance.
   The prize salutes a range of sustainability achievements, such as our assortment of responsibly
   produced goods (more than 100,000 in 2019) and our Zero Waste programme.
   In 2020, our retail areas posted combined revenue of €10.52 billion and EBITDA of
   €52.42 million.

   BUSINESS AREAS
   All our business areas continued to innovate and constantly adapt to our customers’ needs:
   FMCG
   Our supermarkets and hypermarkets qualified for the purposes of the state of emergency as
   “essential services” and thus stayed open throughout the year, even through the lockdown, to
   ensure that staple consumer goods remained always available. We worked very closely with
   local suppliers to provide them with support and boost the visibility of local and Spanish
   products.
   The supermarkets business unit delivered on its commitment to personalisation, quality and
   assured standards at its physical and online stores, thus becoming a benchmark in the sector.
   Customers are offered the same range of goods on both channels, as the website and the mo-
   bile phone app provide the same possibilities as the physical store: for instance, you can even
   specify the type and fineness of cut of foods from the meat, fish, cheese and deli counters.
   We also launched our new food label, “El Corte Inglés Selection”, which brings together 600
   premium-quality SKUs.
   Luxury foods and catering
   El Corte Inglés decided to partner with home delivery companies that specialise in ready meals
   and restaurants to bring our catering to customers’ homes, particularly during the months
   when the lockdown was at its strictest. The catering business specifically grew by 2% year on
   year. We also set up a scheme to support the external restaurant and catering businesses that
   operate on El Corte Inglés premises.
   Another major project was the refurbishment of our Gourmet Experience luxury foods space
   at our Castellana department store in Madrid. With premises of more than 2000 m², the stan-
   douts are the wine cellar and the long bar running down the centre of the shop floor. We offer
   a wide range of luxury-label goods and our Club del Gourmet section. Also at our Castellana
   site, we opened El Patio del Espejo, an avant garde restaurant concept.
   We opened the Las Nubes restaurant at our Diagonal site in Barcelona.
                                                                                                   Above: Gourmet Experience in the Castellana flagship store (Madrid).

   El Corte Inglés-Grandes Armazéns, S.A., the Group’s department store chain in Portugal, ce-
   lebrates its 20th anniversary this year. The Lisbon site opened in 2001 and the Gaia Porto site
   in 2006. The chain also operates six Supercor supermarkets.
   In 2020, the digital transformation of the Portuguese company accelerated, largely as a result
   of the two-month lockdown in response to the pandemic. This led to an increase in the online
   business. Logistics operations were reinforced to meet the large number of home delivery or-
   ders from supermarkets and other categories. Alongside this, we launched same-day delivery
   services to make shopping easier for our customers while complying with pandemic measures.
   In 2020, the online store saw a 74.8% spike in unique visitors with respect to the previous year,
   topping 46.7 million visits.
   Marketing campaigns focused on Portuguese-sourced foods so as to support local suppliers. In
   Portugal, 86.4% of goods and services purchased were sourced locally: this was warmly recei-
   ved by customers looking for local products. Currently, we purchase food products from more
   than 800 Portuguese suppliers.
   In response to the hardships caused by the pandemic, we launched several initiatives to help
   the most vulnerable.
   The pandemic forced the cancellation of Ámbito Cultural’s scheduled in-person events in Por-
   tugal, so the entire arts programme was reorganised and moved online.
   We hosted 136 online activities relating to music, literature, poetry, history, film and current  The terrace at our Lisbon (Portugal) department store.

   Our Supercor supermarket chain was created to meet basic shopping basket needs. Our stores
   have long opening hours and uphold the commitment to quality, service and reliability that
   is the hallmark of the El Corte Inglés Group. This year, our Supercor and Supercor Exprés
   convenience stores played a key role: despite the restrictions in response to the pandemic, they
   stayed open so that customers could shop for food and other basics. In March, April and May,
   when the lockdown was at its strictest, we saw a spike in telephone orders.
   We have always given priority to sourcing our products locally; this year, however, we worked
   even more closely with local suppliers to support them through these tough times, lending visi-
   bility to Spanish produce and ensuring that customers had all the basics available at all times.
   The 181 Supercor and Supercor Express stores widened the scope of their customer services.
   From Christmas 2020 onwards, customers can buy toys from the El Corte Inglés online cata-
   logue and pick them up at the Group’s supermarkets. Soon afterwards, we added electronics
   and domestic appliances to the same scheme. Now customers can place orders with in-store
   checkout staff and pick up the goods at the store itself or, if the goods are large or heavy, have
   them home-delivered instead.
   These new services are layered on top of the option to buy goods on the El Corte Inglés website
   and pick them up at any Supercor or Supercor Exprés store: the approach adapts to the needs
   of omnichannel customers.
   Moreover, we opened a new Supercor Exprés store in Madrid city centre which obtained the
   highest AIS (Accessibility Indicator System) certification level (5 stars) and was also certified
   by Fundación para la Accesibilidad y Responsabilidad Social (ARS). This is the first store in the
   chain to have “beepcon” wireless beacons installed that help customers with sensorial disabili-
   ties find their way around. The wireless beacon initiative helps the sensorially disabled in their
   day-to-day lives by giving them the independence to shop for themselves at our stores.

   69,000 customer surveys (2019: 78,275), obtaining a very good overall satisfaction score of
   91.9% (2019: 92%). That performance is particularly positive in light of the difficulties faced in
   keeping our standards of service at the levels we are known for despite Covid-19. The altera-

    Sustainability is part of every aspect of our ranges. In 2020 we increased the sustainability
    attributes embedded into our products.
      AREA                   NOTEWORTHY INITIATIVES
      FMCG                   Our private label toilet paper features the ECOLABEL seal and all of our tissue paper products are
                             either FSC or PEFC certified.
                             Our 1-litre extra virgin olive oil bottles have a 51% rPET content (made entirely from materials
                             recycled after consumption).
                             We launched three cold cuts SKUs with animal wellbeing certification, ""Welfair"", adding to other
                             products in this category that already carry that seal.
                             We work with local breeders and products that carry protective geographic indications.
                             We have had a sustainable fishing policy since 2011 with the aim of enhancing marine life and
                             ocean sustainability. Specifically we have:
                                     • 20 private label products with Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification, which
                                       manages impacts on wild fish populations and their ecosystems.
                                     • Products certified with the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) seal, leveraging
                                       responsible fish farming practices.
                                     • We have a local purchasing model for supplying establishments located close to the coast
                                       (local platforms, purchases from fresh fish markets, agreements with fishing guilds, etc.).
                             We have local bread and pastry suppliers for regional specialities.
                             In Portugal, the private label gift wrap is FSC/PEFC certified and the fruit departments have
                             increased the use of trays made from compostable materials.
      Fashion                We have increased the percentage of Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) and organic cotton in our
                             clothing.
                             We are developing and expanding products made from recycled materials (nylon, polyester and
                             cashmere).
                             We have increased the clothing ranges made locally.
                             We have replaced plastic packaging with more sustainable materials such as FSC-certified board
                             and biodegradable plastic.
      Home décor             Here too we have increased the percentage of Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) cotton.
                             We have reinforced the assortment of furniture and textiles made responsibly thanks to GOTS, FSC
                             and PEFC seals that verify the use of processes that minimise environmental damage and improve
                             traceability.
      Entertainment          We have increased the number of SKUs with sustainability attributes (FSC certification) in nearly
                             all toy categories.
                             We are championing circular economy initiatives in electronics by introducing new products made
                             of wheat straw (30%) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPUs) (60%).

    The implications of the pandemic prompted us swiftly to move many of our training pro-
    grammes to an online format. Face-to-face training is now provided only for the longer, more
    technically complex courses that require in-person presence to be effective.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             7.1%

    larger number of people (818,823 trainees in 2020 as against 582,761 trainees in 2019). Many
    training programmes could be completed flexibly using any device (smartphones or tablets).
    Online training was already an established feature in previous years, but 2020 saw the key
    development of a standardised content creation model for mobility-enabled courses.
    Pandemic-related strictures also limited the number of training hours provided in 2020
    (1,160,781 hours, versus 1,671,461 hours in 2019). Moreover, since the costs of online training
    are lower than for face-to-face, we spent less on training (€14.3 million in 2020 versus €23.1                                                                             Executives and Managers (1,371h)

    Our Corporate Equality Team comprises representatives of the equality schemes within
    each Group company. Each Group company itself has a monitoring committee that as-
    sesses equality schemes on an annual basis to examine the state of progress and check
    whether targets have been met. The Corporate Equality Team meets every quarter to
    monitor developments, share proposals and report on activities.
    El Corte Inglés-Grandes Armazéns, for its part, set up its own equality committee and
    adhered to Portugal’s diversity charter.
    Our management model continues to support women’s career development to contribute

    •  In 2020, we collected more waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) than
       the year before, achieving one of our goals in spite of the pandemic. We increased the frac-
       tion of equipment earmarked for reuse and ensured that WEEE collected at our depart-
       ment stores was recycled.
    •  The circular economy comes into plays in everything we do by using:
       •    Recycled cardboard boxes from used cardboard packaging.
       •    Recycled plastic bags using chips from our plastic packaging waste.
       •    Reused hangers, baskets and pallets.
       •    Toys, wood, metals, and raw materials for other processes.
    •  We took part in circular economy-related research projects, such as Life EPS Sure, with
       which we have been collaborating since 2017. That initiative demonstrated the possibility
       of obtaining recycled chips from expanded polystyrene (EPS) to produce new recycled EPS

     Especially at the beginning, the pandemic prompted the Group to speed up its digitalisation
     and expand its omnichannel presence to tackle the challenges. El Corte Inglés plays to its
     competitive strengths (e.g. prime locations in many towns, best-in-class service quality to      Real estate management

     Fluid dialogue with customers and other stakeholders creates value and fosters trust in our
     company. We have control tools (e.g. the model for measuring potential reputational risks,
     ongoing monitoring of mass and social media, surveys) to help ensure a consistent and
     coherent message that earns the trust of our stakeholders.
     In its efforts to continuously improve, El Corte Inglés uses this dialogue to identify potential
     opportunities in other sectors so it can offer all its stakeholders a broader product and
     service offering. The main achievements in the year are discussed in the chapter entitled
     “Our business model”.

       Financial and management reporting
       For us to use information effectively and efficiently in our decision-making, it must be of
       good quality. We have to have accurate financial and management information.
       The Group has embarked on projects to ensure it has reliable and timely information from
       the finance and management analysis and control areas. Increasing non-financial reporting
       requirements on several fronts poses a risk. To address this risk, work is being done to
       improve management of the information requested, its quality and its communication.
       In terms of financial reporting, El Corte Inglés has an Internal control over financial reporting
       (ICFR) system that complies with the requirements of Spain’s securities market regulator
       (Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores or “CNMV”.
       COMPLIANCE
    The Group is subject to compliance with myriad regulations. The Compliance area works
    together with the entire company to assess, identify, measure and oversee all compliance
    risks. The area has grouped related initiatives into two major categories:
    •    Criminal law: focusing on all non-compliance risks expressly defined as criminal in
         Spain’s Criminal Code.
    •    Corporate regulations: assessing all risks related to specific rules and regulations affec-
         ting the Group’s various areas.
    Specific compliance-related actions are presented in the “Regulation” section of the “Our
    governance” chapter.

       Data for average annual contracts were reported for the first time in 2019. Therefore, figures for 2018 are not included and comparisons are
    with workforce numbers at year-end 2018. Similarly, for the average data, the employee figures have been weighted based on the length of
    time they have been part of the workforce. Thus, the total is sum of the breakdowns.
