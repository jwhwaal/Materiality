Sustainability topics
From different angles, we at Jumbo are working to make our business operations and
product range more sustainable. By closely following market developments, we can
respond to what is going on in society. We work on sustainability from the ground up
and want to create as good and as much impact as possible. We are working on
sustainability themes that are not only relevant to Jumbo, but also to
our stakeholders. In the About this Report section, we describe the (creation of the)
materiality matrix and the process towards an integrated report in which we prepare for an
independent auditor's report on the non-financial data. More information on our
sustainability themes and performance can be found at Jumborapportage.com.

Our stakeholders have named ten topics as 'high material themes'. We have also added our
own themes. All of these themes are topical, tie in with the spearheads of our long-term
strategy and have been identified by customers, employees and other stakeholders as relevant
to Jumbo. Based on this stakeholder research, we have linked the set of material themes to
five overarching focal points:
    1. Eating and living healthier, making tasty and healthy food easily accessible to
        everyone.
            2.
            o Healthy products
            o Healthy Lifestyle
    2. Products with care for people, animals and the environment, affordable for the

Food waste
We organize our chain in such a way that food ends up in the right place as much as
possible. As a result, we need to throw away much less food.

Packaging and waste
At Jumbo, we make sure that the environmental impact of packaging is as low as possible and
that our waste can be reused as a raw material wherever possible.
In many cases, packaging has an important function, for example to maintain the quality of
products and reduce waste. We prefer

more sustainable materials, but opinions on sustainable packaging are quite divergent.
One thing is certain: we need to move toward less packaging waste.
