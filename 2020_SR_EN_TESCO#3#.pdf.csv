The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has developed a set of globally applicable, industry-specific
sustainability standards. These identify financially material topics and associated metrics, in order for companies to
communicate their sustainability approach and performance to investors. Our reporting below is based on the
standards for the Food Retailers & Distributors industry.
