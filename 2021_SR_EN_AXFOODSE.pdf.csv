In the Axfood Group we are working continuously to strengthen

customers’ growing interest in more sustainable consumption
as well as increased demand for locally produced plant-based
products, like vegetarian and vegan alternatives without soy.

                                 Sweden’s population is growing – more people need to eat
                                 The food retail market is relatively unaffected by economic swings and is driven largely by population
                                 growth and inflation. Sweden’s population is one of the fastest growing in Europe and is projected
                                 to reach more than 11 million by 2030 and nearly 13 million by 2070, according to Statistics Sweden.
                                 Food price inflation in 2020 was 2.1% according to preliminary data from Statistics Sweden.

                                 Axfood’s strategy is addressing the market’s drivers and generating profitable growth
                                 Axfood has a clear strategy for addressing the trends in the market through concrete priorities
                                 in six focus areas: the customer meeting, the customer offering, expansion, the supply chain,
                                 work approach and our people. The goal is to grow more than the market with a long-term operating
                                 margin of at least 4%.

                                 House of well-positioned brands
                                 Axfood is a house of brands with strong positions in their respective segments. Having distinctive food
                                 concepts is a way of meeting customers’ varying needs and diversifying risk. Willys is the leader in the
                                 discount segment, Hemköp is a strong actor in the traditional grocery segment, and Mat.se simplifies
                                 daily life for e-commerce customers. Through Snabbgross and Urban Deli, Axfood is firmly established
                                 in the café and restaurant market. With Apohem, the Group also has a position in the online pharmacy
                                 market.

                                 Sustainable economies of scale and close collaboration
                                 Economies of scale and cost efficiency are achieved through close collaboration within Axfood
                                 between the central functions and Group companies. Dagab is the joint purchasing and logistics com-
                                 pany, setting high demands for price, quality and sustainability. Efficient and modern logistics convey
                                 many advantages and create conditions for profitable growth and a continuous improvement of the
                                 customer offering. Major emphasis is put on cultivating good relationships with suppliers and increasing
                                 control and responsibility across the entire supply chain. Axfood’s central IT function plays a crucial role
                                 in continuously developing the Group’s digital services, operations and ways of working.
05
                                 Channels and formats that simplify and attract more customers
                                 The physical stores are the heart of Axfood’s business. At the same time, the strong growth online
                                 shows that customers appreciate Axfood’s various e-commerce concepts. With a clear expansion plan,
                                 focus on developing the customer meeting regardless of channel, and development of sustainable and
                                 easy meal solutions, Axfood is catering to customers’ evolving behaviours in the food retail market.
06
                                 Strong financial position and stable cash flow
                                 Axfood has a solid balance sheet, and the business model generates stable cash flow. During the last
                                 five years the dividend has averaged 91% of profit after tax. According to Axfood’s dividend policy, the
                                 shareholder dividend is to be at least 50% of profit after tax. The dividend is paid out on two occasions.
                                 Axfood’s gearing is low, and excluding the accounting effects of IFRS 16, the Group reported a net debt
                                 receivable at year-end.

                                 Positive force in society
                                 Axfood has long been working to be a positive force in society. This means offering good and
                                 ­sustainable food for everyone and being an inclusive business that is conducted in a responsible way,
                                  not least with respect to climate impact. Through its private labels Axfood launches innovative ­products

   and efficiency in the Group’s joint dark stores improved.
   Modern and efficient logistics
   Dagab’s logistics operation is the heart of Axfood’s logistics
   flow. From eight store warehouses goods are distributed to
   the Group’s own stores and external customers, such as retail-
   er-owned stores and convenience retailers. Two dark stores
   handle home deliveries for Axfood’s e-commerce business in
   Stockholm and Gothenburg. Dagab’s delivery fleet is made up
   of 150 heavy duty trucks that deliver goods from the Group’s
   store warehouses. Approximately half of all volume is handled
   by the Group’s own fleet, which has a number of advantages,
   including that Axfood can use its own transport knowledge and
   experience to set high demands on the transport services that
   it procures externally. In addition to its heavy trucks, Dagab has
   110 light trucks and vans for e-commerce deliveries.
   Logistics centre in Bålsta taking shape
   Construction of the Group’s future, highly automated logistics
   centre in Bålsta continued on schedule during the year. The
   logistics centre will be one of the largest and most modern
   of its kind in Europe and will lead to increased productivity.
   The investment is unique as it will gather the entire flow and
   processes for stores, e-commerce and convenience retailing
   under one and the same roof. The logistics centre will handle all
   temperature zones and contribute to further optimization of the
   product flow through a faster and more flexible supply chain.
   Through Axfood’s omnichannel solution, the underlying pro-
   cesses will also be made more efficient, which will help reduce
   food waste. The logistics centre will handle 60% of Dagab’s
   volumes, plus space is being built to further increase capacity
   by at least 40% compared with 2019 volume. The new capacity

Axfood’s vision is to be the leader in good and sustainable food. Sustainability work is therefore
extensive and permeates the entire Group. Sustainability is an integral part of the business
and the work is decribed within the three areas of food, the environment and people. Long-term
sustainable decisions will enable Axfood to grow, create new business opportunities and achieve
profitable growth.
Sustainable development is about seeing the whole picture and        the environment, the food that is produced and sold in stores,
striving for improvements within the framework of the planet’s       and the people who produce, sell and consume it. Within these
limits – what it can sustain today and over the longer term.         areas Axfood is working strategically with key performance
Axfood is therefore working systematically to ensure sustaina-       indicators and targets that are coupled to Sweden’s Environ-
bility in all parts of the value chain. This is done by safeguarding mental Objectives and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Axfood has set a target that 20% of the Group’s managers will
have an international background. During 2020 this share was
15%, which is level with the preceding year. Within the respec-
tive companies’ management teams (including Group and staff
management), the share increased to 10% (4%).
Business ethics and discrimination
To maintain high trust among customers, suppliers and other
stakeholders, it is important to uphold and strive for transpar-
ency and good business ethics. All persons who perform work
for Axfood or who in some other way represent the Group are
– apart from acting in accordance with applicable regulations
and laws – obligated to adhere to the Group’s ethical conduct
rules and equal treatment policy. All employees who have an
authorization right sign the ethical guidelines in connection with
their hiring. Suppliers that are invoiced on a continuous basis
are required to certify that they accept Axfood’s Code of Con-
duct. In addition, to ensure adherence to the ethical guidelines
and Code of Conduct, all employees with an authorization right
or who can in some other way influence purchasing decisions
for products or services are required to sign the ethical conduct
rules every year.
   Axfood’s whistleblower function contributes to adherence of
the Code of Conduct. The whistleblower function is a key tool
for upholding good corporate governance and contributing
to an effective process in which the Executive Committee is
quickly informed about risks and deficiencies in the operations
to be able to investigate and remedy them. All wholly owned
companies within the Group, except for Urban Deli and Cold
Cargo, have access to Axfood’s whistleblower service. The ser-
vice is provided by an external contractor, which enables anon-
ymous reporting. Cases reported via the whistleblower service
are initially addressed by the Group’s whistleblower committee.
The committee was established in 2016 and consists of four
employees from different parts of operations. When needed,
external specialists are brought in. The number of reported and
addressed cases is reported yearly to the Board of Directors.
   The matters submitted via the whistleblower function in 2020
were addressed in accordance with the established routine.
One matter qualified as a whistleblower case. The matter was
investigated and was concluded during the current reporting
period. The remaining matters were forwarded to other func-
tions within the respective companies for further handling.

Sustainability programme
Sustainability programme
Axfood’s sustainability programme encompasses short- and long-term targets.
A majority of the targets are coupled to Sweden’s Environmental Objectives
and the UN’s Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Of the SDGs,
“Responsible consumption and production” and “Climate action” are the most
relevant for Axfood.
Axfood’s sustainability programme is revised on a continuous basis and is updated on the Group’s website. New targets are added
as the Group’s sustainability work develops, and certain targets are replaced with new ones. In 2020 the targets in the sustainability
programme were rearranged in accordance with the following areas – food, the environment and people.

Chairman’s message
Governance for long-term
sustainable and profitable growth
Axfood’s Board is tasked with ensuring that
the Group develops and grows in a long-term
sustainable and profitable manner. To create
value for shareholders and other stakeholders,
Axfood must work responsibly and be a
driver of positive development in society.
As Chairman of the Board I am particularly
proud of how Axfood, during a year of
global turbulence, succeeded in combining
social responsibility and long-termism with
development and growth.
The past year has been extraordinary, and in this time of major
strain on people and societies, it has become clear what an
important role the food retail industry has. With decisiveness,
engagement and perseverance, Axfood has met the new
challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, and I am
very impressed by the capacity to act and the vigour shown
by employees throughout the organization. People and
interpersonal cooperation are the most important factors for
conducting successful business, and this became extra clear
this year. Axfood’s Board has done its utmost to support the
Company’s management in dealing with all the consequences
